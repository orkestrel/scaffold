# HTML

> A zero-runtime-dependency-beyond-`@orkestrel/contract`, types-first HTML parser, renderer, sanitizer, and distiller — a hand-written, index-based tokenizer that turns any HTML string into a typed AST held by an immutable `HTML` handle, plus standalone projections that write that AST back out (canonical HTML, or structural plain text). Source: [`src/core`](../src/core). Published through `@orkestrel/html`; surfaced in-repo through the `@src/core` barrel.

HTML here is: parse once into an `HTML` handle, then treat every output as a projection of it. `parseDocument` scans a page or a bare fragment — the same shape either way — into an `HTMLDocument`: a discriminated union of plain readonly node values keyed by `category`, the axis that varies. Parsing is TOTAL. Every input produces a document, so there are no parse options, no issue list, no strict mode, and no error path; strictness lives in the guards and in the renderer's refusals instead. Nothing is implied or inserted that the source did not write — no synthesized `html` / `head` / `body`, and a `<!DOCTYPE html>` is an ordinary child in source order — which is exactly why a fragment and a whole page need no mode switch between them. An `HTML` handle wraps that AST with query (`walk` / `find` / `filter` / `reduce`), rewrite (`map`), fold, and shallow streaming, and with the two document-shaping engines: `sanitize`, which enforces a security floor no option can lower, and `distill`, which extracts the prose a reader — or a language model — actually wants, and hands it back as a handle rather than a string, because the AST is what carries the structure. The renderers (`renderHTML`, `renderText`) are separate, downstream, standalone functions from AST → string; none of them assumes its input came from `parseDocument` on trusted markup, none of them throws, and every one of them degrades at a fixed depth cap rather than exhausting the call stack. The AST itself is the primary contract, with a from-unknown validation surface (`isHTMLNode` / `isHTMLDocument` / `isElementNode` / …) for the moment an AST arrives from somewhere other than this parser.

That totality statement governs document parsing. `parseStartTag` is the separate fail-closed source boundary: it returns one unambiguous start tag within the package's deliberately narrow ASCII tag-name grammar and its exact end offset, or `undefined`, without adding a strict mode to `parseDocument` or changing `scanTag` recovery.

## Surface

### Types

The full node shape and handle contract, from [`types.ts`](../src/core/types.ts). `category` is the discriminant every node carries; absence is always `undefined`, never a sentinel.

| Name                 | Kind      | Shape                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HTMLAttribute`      | interface | `{ name: string, value?: string }` — one attribute; `name` is ASCII-lowercased, `value` is ABSENT for `<input disabled>` and `''` for `<input disabled="">`.                                                                                    |
| `HTMLStartTag`       | interface | `{ name, attributes, slashed, next }` — one unambiguous start tag from `parseStartTag`; `slashed` reports a syntactically separate trailing solidus and `next` is the exact exclusive UTF-16 offset after its true closing `>`.                 |
| `HTMLTag`            | interface | `{ name, attributes, closing, next }` — one start or close tag from total `scanTag`; a recovered start tag retains its recovered `next`, and a close tag has no attributes.                                                                     |
| `ElementNode`        | interface | `{ category: 'element', name, attributes, children }` — any tag, known or custom; `attributes` in source order, `children` empty for a void element.                                                                                            |
| `TextNode`           | interface | `{ category: 'text', value: string }` — a run of character data; `value` is DECODED (references resolved, not yet re-encoded).                                                                                                                  |
| `CommentNode`        | interface | `{ category: 'comment', value: string }` — `<!-- … -->`; `value` is verbatim, never decoded and never parsed as markup, and a parser-produced one is always REPRESENTABLE (§ [The AST model](#the-ast-model)).                                  |
| `DoctypeNode`        | interface | `{ category: 'doctype', name, public?, system? }` — the declared root name plus the external identifiers of a legacy declaration.                                                                                                               |
| `HTMLDocument`       | interface | `{ category: 'document', children: readonly HTMLNode[] }` — the single root, whether the input was a page or a fragment.                                                                                                                        |
| `HTMLNode`           | type      | `HTMLDocument \| ElementNode \| TextNode \| CommentNode \| DoctypeNode` — the exhaustive set every guard, traversal, fold table, and renderer covers.                                                                                           |
| `HTMLHandler`        | type      | `(node: TNode, children: readonly T[]) => T` — one fold step, receiving its children ALREADY folded to `T`.                                                                                                                                     |
| `HTMLHandlers`       | interface | One `HTMLHandler` per category (`document`, `element`, `text`, `comment`, `doctype`) — every key required, because a fold is total.                                                                                                             |
| `HTMLRewriteHandler` | type      | `(node: HTMLNode) => HTMLNode` — a bottom-up, copy-on-write one-to-one node rewrite for `map`.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `HTMLPruneHandler`   | type      | `(node: HTMLNode) => readonly HTMLNode[]` — the one-to-MANY dual of a rewrite: `[]` drops, `node.children` unwraps, `[node]` keeps.                                                                                                             |
| `SanitizeOptions`    | interface | `{ elements?, attributes?, schemes?, comments? }` — each allowlist is a `ReadonlySet<string>` or a `readonly string[]` and REPLACES its default; the floor sits underneath and cannot be lowered (§ [The sanitize floor](#the-sanitize-floor)). |
| `DistillOptions`     | interface | `{ base?, elements?, boilerplate? }` — the URL relative values resolve against, plus the content set kept and the regions removed whole, each a `ReadonlySet<string>` or a `readonly string[]` (§ [The distill pass](#the-distill-pass)).       |
| `HTMLInterface`      | interface | `{ document, walk, find, filter, map, reduce, fold, stream, sanitize, distill }` — the AST root plus every operation over it; `document` is a readonly data member, the rest are in [`## Methods`](#methods).                                   |

### Constants

The element vocabularies, allowlists, entity table, and depth bound every engine reads, from [`constants.ts`](../src/core/constants.ts). Every collection is a frozen array, or — for the two keyed tables — a frozen record read through `Object.hasOwn`, so nothing a consumer can reach changes what an engine sees (§ [The sanitize floor](#the-sanitize-floor)).

| Name                   | Kind  | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HTML_WHITESPACE`      | const | `' \t\n\f\r'` — the five code points HTML treats as syntax whitespace; scanners do not mistake JavaScript's broader Unicode whitespace set for tag separation.                                                                                                                               |
| `VOID_ELEMENTS`        | const | `readonly string[]` — the 13 elements that cannot have children (`area` … `wbr`). Voidness is DERIVED from the name here, never stored on a node, so the two can never disagree.                                                                                                             |
| `RAW_ELEMENTS`         | const | `readonly string[]` — `['script', 'style']`: content is one verbatim, undecoded `TextNode` up to the case-insensitive close tag, with no tag scanning inside.                                                                                                                                |
| `LITERAL_ELEMENTS`     | const | `readonly string[]` — `['textarea', 'title']`: like raw text, but character references ARE decoded, so `<title>a &amp; b</title>` holds `a & b`.                                                                                                                                             |
| `BLOCK_ELEMENTS`       | const | `readonly string[]` — the structural elements; they are what implicitly closes an open `p` and what `renderText` treats as a line boundary.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `IMPLIED_CLOSERS`      | const | `Readonly<Record<string, readonly string[]>>` — for each element that may be left open, the start tags whose arrival closes it. `p`'s entry IS `BLOCK_ELEMENTS` itself rather than a second copy, so the two cannot drift.                                                                   |
| `SAFE_ELEMENTS`        | const | `readonly string[]` — `sanitize`'s default element allowlist: the document vocabulary that survives unchanged. A SAFE element outside it is unwrapped, not dropped.                                                                                                                          |
| `SAFE_ATTRIBUTES`      | const | `readonly string[]` — `sanitize`'s default attribute allowlist: `align alt cite class colspan dir height href lang rowspan span start title width`. Deliberately narrow — no `id`, no `style`, no handler, and no resource `src`; `align` remains subject to the cell-and-value floor below. |
| `TABLE_ALIGNMENTS`     | const | `readonly string[]` — `['center', 'left', 'right']`: the closed normalized values a sanitized table-cell `align` attribute may carry.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `TABLE_CELL_ELEMENTS`  | const | `readonly string[]` — `['td', 'th']`: the only elements on which sanitized `align` is honored, whatever a caller's attribute allowlist names.                                                                                                                                                |
| `SAFE_URL_SCHEMES`     | const | `readonly string[]` — `['http', 'https', 'mailto', 'tel']`. A relative URL is always allowed; every unlisted scheme is refused.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `URL_ATTRIBUTES`       | const | `readonly string[]` — `['action', 'cite', 'formaction', 'href', 'poster', 'src']`: the values `sanitize` decodes and scheme-checks, and `distill` resolves against `DistillOptions.base`.                                                                                                    |
| `UNSAFE_ELEMENTS`      | const | `readonly string[]` — the hard floor: subtrees removed WHOLE whatever the options say, because unwrapping them is what makes them dangerous (a `script` body is live markup the moment its wrapper disappears).                                                                              |
| `CONTENT_ELEMENTS`     | const | `readonly string[]` — `distill`'s default keep list: prose, headings, lists, tables, code, and the inline marks that carry meaning. Everything else safe melts into it.                                                                                                                      |
| `BOILERPLATE_ELEMENTS` | const | `readonly string[]` — `['aside', 'footer', 'header', 'menu', 'nav']`: `distill`'s default regions, removed WITH their children, because a navigation menu's link text is noise in every reading of the page.                                                                                 |
| `REGION_ELEMENTS`      | const | `readonly string[]` — `['main', 'article']`: the content regions `distill` re-roots at, tried in order; a name qualifies only when it occurs EXACTLY once.                                                                                                                                   |
| `NAMED_ENTITIES`       | const | `Readonly<Record<string, string>>` — the table exactly matches the vendored WHATWG semicolon-terminated name → character reference set. Lookup is own-property only (`Object.hasOwn`), so a hostile name such as `&constructor;` is not an entry; an unlisted name stays literal.            |
| `MAX_DEPTH`            | const | `64` — the recursion bound the parser, the guards, the traversals, the renderers, and both shaping engines all honor (§ [Depth degrade semantics](#depth-degrade-semantics)).                                                                                                                |

### Validators

Two guard families, from [`validators.ts`](../src/core/validators.ts). The from-unknown guards validate an entire untrusted value from scratch — a deserialized AST, a value crossing a process boundary — and are total: a cycle, a hostile prototype, a revoked proxy, or 10,000 levels of nesting returns `false` rather than throwing. The name predicates answer a question about one element or URL string and are what the engines consult.

### Parsers

The document coercer, from [`parsers.ts`](../src/core/parsers.ts). `parseDocument` is the spine — the single recursive pass that turns source into an AST. Every lexical piece it composes is a pure leaf in [`helpers.ts`](../src/core/helpers.ts) (§ [Helpers](#helpers)), exported and independently testable, because a scanner nobody can call is a scanner nobody can prove. All of them are index-based, with no backtracking regex over untrusted input.

| `parseDocument` | function | `(html: string) => HTMLDocument` | Parses a page or fragment into an `HTMLDocument`. TOTAL — malformed markup recovers per the [recovery table](#the-parse-pipeline) instead of throwing — and guarantees no two adjacent text siblings. |

### Helpers

Pure, total leaves from [`helpers.ts`](../src/core/helpers.ts) — the lexical scanners `parseDocument` composes, and the functional core `HTML`'s engines compose and callers reach for directly on a bare node. Every one of them is independently testable and none of them throws: a hostile value degrades to `''`, to an empty list, or to the input unchanged.

### Shapers

Declarative `ContractShape` values (from `@orkestrel/contract`) in [`shapers.ts`](../src/core/shapers.ts) — one shape compiles into a JSON Schema, a guard, a coercing parser, and a seeded generator that can never drift apart. A shape tree has no lazy or self-referential node, so only the LEAVES of this AST shape here; `ElementNode` and `HTMLDocument` recurse into `HTMLNode` and therefore stay hand-written, cycle- and depth-capped guards in `validators.ts`.

| Name             | Kind  | Builds                                                                                                   |

| `commentShape`   | const | The shape of a `CommentNode` — the verbatim leaf a bogus comment also recovers to.                       |

### `HTML`

The implementing class of `HTMLInterface`, from [`HTML.ts`](../src/core/HTML.ts). A parsed document handle: constructed from an HTML `string` (runs `parseDocument`, which is total, so there is nothing to catch) or from an already-parsed `HTMLDocument` (adopted AS-IS and not re-validated — gate an untrusted value with `isHTMLDocument` first). It exposes its AST through the `readonly document` member, documented here in Surface prose rather than in the [`## Methods`](#methods) table below, which lists exactly `HTMLInterface`'s call-signature members. Immutable: nothing mutates the stored AST, and `map`, `sanitize`, and `distill` each return a NEW handle whose root invariant (`category: 'document'`) always holds. `walk` is the deep traversal — lazy, depth-first, pre-order, root-inclusive — and `find` / `filter` / `reduce` all iterate it, so one ordering law covers the whole query surface; `stream` is the deliberate contrast, shallow and backpressured. The two engines are private methods composing the pure leaves in `helpers.ts` over one shared bottom-up spine, `pruneDocument`.

## Methods

The public methods of each behavioral interface — one table per type, keyed by its backticked name. The `readonly document` member is Surface-documented above, not listed here.

#### `HTMLInterface`

| Method     | Returns                               | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `walk`     | `Generator<HTMLNode>`                 | THE deep traversal — lazy, depth-first, pre-order, root-inclusive, over every node. The sync `for…of` surface is also consumable by `for await…of`, so an async pipeline needs no second iterator.                                                    |
| `find`     | `T \| HTMLNode \| undefined`          | The first node in walk order, narrowed by a type guard or matched by a predicate; `undefined` when nothing matches.                                                                                                                                   |
| `filter`   | `readonly T[] \| readonly HTMLNode[]` | Every node in walk order, narrowed by a type guard or matched by a predicate; a fresh array per call.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `map`      | `HTMLInterface`                       | Rewrites the AST bottom-up (copy-on-write) through an `HTMLRewriteHandler` and returns a NEW handle; a rewrite that returns its node unchanged shares that subtree instead of copying it.                                                             |
| `reduce`   | `T`                                   | Accumulates one value over the AST in depth-first pre-order through a plain reducer callback.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `fold`     | `T`                                   | Runs a total catamorphism over the document with an `HTMLHandlers<T>` table — one handler per category, no node skipped — so a structure-aware projection needs no traversal of its own.                                                              |
| `stream`   | `ReadableStream<HTMLNode>`            | A fresh, web-standard, pull-based stream over the root's DIRECT children (shallow, source order): one node per `pull`, so a slow consumer's backpressure is respected. Cancellable, independently replayable, pipeable through any `TransformStream`. |
| `sanitize` | `HTMLInterface`                       | Removes every unsafe element, attribute, and URL and returns a NEW handle. Options replace the default allowlists; the floor holds regardless (§ [The sanitize floor](#the-sanitize-floor)).                                                          |
| `distill`  | `HTMLInterface`                       | Extracts the page's content — regions and hidden chrome pruned, then sanitized, then re-rooted, then reduced to the content vocabulary — and returns a NEW handle, never a string (§ [The distill pass](#the-distill-pass)).                          |

## The AST model

Every node is plain, readonly data with no behavior — a discriminated union keyed by `category`, the axis that varies, never `kind` or `type`. Five categories, one root, no second family:

- **`document`** is the root and the only container the parser ever creates for the whole input. There is exactly one, and `HTMLInterface` guarantees it: a page and a fragment are the same shape, because nothing is implied or inserted.
- **`element`** carries a lowercased `name`, `attributes` in source order, and `children`. Voidness, raw-textness, and block-ness are all DERIVED from the name against `VOID_ELEMENTS` / `RAW_ELEMENTS` / `BLOCK_ELEMENTS` — there is no `void` or `selfClosing` flag on a node to disagree with its own tag.
- **`text`** carries decoded character data. The parser resolves references on the way in; the renderers re-encode minimally on the way out.
- **`comment`** carries verbatim, never-decoded inner text. A bogus comment (`<?…>`, a non-doctype `<!…>`, a CDATA section) recovers to this same node, which is why the AST needs no processing-instruction or CDATA category. The tokenizer builds only values it can write back: a produced `value` never begins with `>` or `->` and never contains `-->` or `--!>`, because an abrupt `<!-->` / `<!--->` closes as an EMPTY comment and an incorrect `--!>` close ends the comment exactly where a `-->` would, leaving what follows as ordinary text. The invariant lives in the tokenizer rather than the renderer because a comment decodes nothing — escaping inside one would change its text, not protect it — so a hand-built value that breaks it is dropped at render time instead (§ [Roundtrip laws](#roundtrip-laws)).
- **`doctype`** carries the declared root `name` plus the optional `public` / `system` identifiers of a legacy declaration. It is an ordinary child in source order and it survives sanitizing: it carries structure, not risk.

Attribute absence is a real distinction, not a sentinel: `value` is `undefined` for a valueless attribute (`<input disabled>`) and `''` for an explicitly empty one (`<input disabled="">`). There is no separate "minimized" flag, so a malformed or unterminated attribute recovers to an absent value rather than to invented text. A duplicate attribute name keeps its FIRST occurrence, matched case-insensitively.

The parser also guarantees one invariant the whole system leans on: **no two adjacent `TextNode` siblings**. A final coalescing pass joins them, which is what makes an AST comparable to its own reparse — and why every pass that unwraps an element (both engines do) rejoins the text it splices together through `mergeText`.

## The parse pipeline

`parseDocument(html)` normalizes line endings and `U+0000`, then walks the source once with an explicit open-element stack — no tree-construction insertion modes, no adoption agency, no foster parenting. Text runs to the next `<`; a `<` that cannot start markup is literal text; a start tag pushes, a close tag pops the nearest match, and `IMPLIED_CLOSERS` closes what the author left open. Raw- and literal-text elements swallow their body to the matching close tag. Past `MAX_DEPTH` the parser stops nesting and appends to the deepest allowed element, so parsing stays total and no text is lost.

`parseStartTag(html, offset)` is deliberately outside that recovery pipeline for a caller that must know where one start tag really ends. It consumes only HTML ASCII whitespace, retains the package's `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9:-]*` tag-name grammar, ASCII-lowercases names without Unicode case folding, refuses duplicate names and malformed or incomplete attribute syntax, does not normalize the source, and returns the exact exclusive UTF-16 `next` offset after the matching `>` — including when a quoted value contains an earlier `>`. Its `slashed` fact reports only a trailing solidus that was not absorbed into an attribute value: `<html disabled/>` and `<html lang=en />` set it, while the slash in `<html lang=en/>` remains part of the unquoted value. Element semantics remain the caller's concern. It owns no element-name, attribute-allowlist, CSP, or application policy. `scanTag` composes the same successful path, then retains its established recovery path for `parseDocument`.

Recovery is specified behavior, not accident. Every row here has a test in [`tests/src/core/parsers.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/parsers.test.ts):

**Entities.** Numeric references decode fully (an invalid scalar becomes `U+FFFD`); named references decode against `NAMED_ENTITIES`, and an unknown name stays literal rather than becoming an invented character.

**Not goals, stated plainly.** This is a pragmatic, total, bounded parser, not a conformant HTML5 tree constructor. It does not implement HTML5 insertion modes, the adoption agency algorithm, or foster parenting; it has no SVG/MathML namespace handling (foreign content is removed whole by `sanitize` instead); named references require their semicolon rather than applying the browser tokenizer's legacy no-semicolon longest-match behavior; the AST and total document parser report no diagnostics, issues, or node-position model (`parseStartTag.next` is only one exact token boundary); it ships no CSS selector engine and no streaming tokenizer; and `distill`'s hidden-content rule reads the `hidden` / `aria-hidden` attributes, never computed style. Each of those is a deliberate exclusion with a cheaper, testable substitute, not an unfinished edge.

### Depth degrade semantics

`MAX_DEPTH` (`64`) bounds every recursion in the package, and each one degrades to a fixed, cheap fallback instead of descending further:

- **Parsing** — past the cap, a start tag opens no new element: its content appends to the deepest allowed element, and a later matching close tag is accounted for without unbalancing the stack. No text is lost.
- **Guards** — `isHTMLNode` (and `isHTMLDocument` / `isElementNode` through it) tracks ancestors and refuses past the cap, so a cycle or an adversarially deep value returns `false` instead of exhausting the stack.
- **`walkNodes`** — the node AT the cap is still yielded; its children are not visited.
- **`foldNode`** — the node at the cap is folded with an EMPTY child list.
- **`renderHTML` / `renderText`** — descent stops at the cap; deeper content is not serialized.
- **`rewriteDocument`** — the subtree at the cap passes through UNCHANGED, by reference.
- **`pruneDocument`** — the node at the cap is handed NO children, so a keep-list policy can never retain content it was unable to inspect. Safety over fidelity, deliberately the opposite trade from `rewriteDocument`'s pass-through.

Every traversal and renderer is also iterative rather than recursive, so the cap bounds output size and work, not stack survival.

## Roundtrip laws

What roundtrips is the AST, NOT the input bytes. Three laws hold on parser-produced roots; laws 1 and 2 are substantiated over a representative parser-produced corpus rather than by a universal proof, in [`tests/src/core/helpers.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/helpers.test.ts) and [`tests/src/core/HTML.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/HTML.test.ts):

1. **AST fixpoint.** For a parser-produced document `d`, `parseDocument(renderHTML(d))` deep-equals `d`. Rendering then reparsing is the identity on parser output.
2. **Canonical idempotence.** For that same `d`, `renderHTML(parseDocument(renderHTML(d))) === renderHTML(d)`. The serialization is canonical: writing it twice writes the same bytes.
3. **Sanitize fixpoint.** `sanitize(sanitize(x))` deep-equals `sanitize(x)` — and sanitizing a REPARSE of sanitized output reaches the same AST too, which is the law that matters when the output travels as a string and comes back.

The differences between the input bytes and the canonical output are enumerated, not incidental:

| Construct                      | Canonical form                                                                                                                                     |

| Character references           | Numeric references decode to their character; an unknown named reference stays literal                                                             |

| Implied closes and mis-nesting | The recovered tree's shape, not the source's tag order                                                                                             |
| Dropped constructs             | Stay dropped — an incomplete tag at EOF, a stray close tag, an unterminated declaration                                                            |
| Comment close variants         | An abrupt `<!-->` / `<!--->` writes as the empty `<!---->`, an incorrect `--!>` close writes as `-->`, and an unterminated comment gains its close |
| Doctype                        | `<!DOCTYPE html>` — uppercase keyword, lowercased name, quoted legacy identifiers                                                                  |

**A hand-built AST gets safety, not fidelity.** `renderHTML` accepts any node, including one no parser produced, and refuses rather than emits a construct that would reopen the document:

| Hand-built violation                                          | Rendered as                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| A void element carrying children                              | `<br>` — the children are ignored               |
| A raw body containing its own close-tag sequence              | `<script></script>` — the body is dropped whole |
| An invalid element name                                       | Its children, with no tag at all                |
| An unwritable attribute name                                  | Omitted                                         |
| An invalid doctype name                                       | Nothing                                         |
| A comment body carrying `-->` / `--!>`, or opening `>` / `->` | Nothing — the comment is dropped WHOLE          |

## The sanitize floor

`sanitize` is a security boundary, and its options are allowed to narrow it, redirect it, or widen the _vocabulary_ — never to open a hole. Each of `elements`, `attributes`, and `schemes` REPLACES its default allowlist rather than extending it, and each accepts either shape of allowlist — a `ReadonlySet<string>` the caller builds, or a `readonly string[]`, so an exported frozen constant such as `SAFE_ELEMENTS` passes straight through without being copied into a `Set` first (`DistillOptions.elements` and `boilerplate` take both shapes too). Underneath all three sits a floor the options cannot lower:

- **`UNSAFE_ELEMENTS` subtrees are removed WHOLE**, never unwrapped, even when the element allowlist names them. Unwrapping is precisely what makes them dangerous: the body of a `script`, `style`, `template`, or `noscript` becomes live markup the moment its wrapper disappears. Foreign content (`svg`, `math`) is here because this AST has no namespaces to police, and the form and metadata elements are here because they act rather than describe.
- **Handler, styling, and namespaced attributes always go**: every case-insensitive `on*` name, `style`, `srcdoc`, `xmlns`, and any name the sanitizer will not write — which is what removes a namespaced `xlink:href`, whose colon is not a writable attribute-name character here — even when the attribute allowlist names them. `sanitize({ attributes: new Set(['href', 'onclick']) })` keeps `href` and still strips `onclick`; an allowlist is not a permission slip.
- **Table-cell alignment is closed and unwidenable.** `align` survives only on `td` and `th`, only with `center`, `left`, or `right`, and is emitted in trimmed lowercase form. Every other element or value loses the attribute even when `SanitizeOptions.attributes` names it. The accepted tradeoff is obsolete presentational HTML: this exact membership rule follows the same allowlisted-then-narrowed pattern as URL attributes without adding value-grammar or CSS parsing. There is deliberately no general `style` or CSS policy axis, because that would add a new parsing surface to the sanitizer.
- **A `URL_ATTRIBUTES` value is decoded before it is judged.** `sanitizeURL` decodes character references to a bounded fixpoint, strips ASCII whitespace and control characters, and only then checks the scheme — so `java&#115;cript:` is not a clever spelling of anything. `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, `file:`, and the protocol-relative forms (`//`, `\\`, `/\`, `\/`) are refused whatever `schemes` says. A value that fails is REMOVED, not emptied, so nothing is left for a later pass to reinterpret. A value that still changes after the decode bound fails closed.
- **A safe element merely outside the allowlist is UNWRAPPED to its children.** Wrapper soup melts while its content survives, and `mergeText` rejoins the text the splice put side by side — which is exactly why the sanitize fixpoint also holds through a reparse.
- **Comments are dropped** unless `comments: true`, and a comment that is KEPT is normalized through the renderer and reparsed, so a hand-built body carrying a close sequence is dropped here as well rather than travelling on. **A doctype survives untouched**, through the same normalization.

Two consequences worth stating out loud. First, `SAFE_ATTRIBUTES` deliberately omits every resource `src`, so a sanitized `img` keeps its `alt` text and loses its download — sanitizing a page removes its ability to phone home, not only its ability to run code. `class` is kept because it is inert once `style`, `link`, `svg`, and `script` are gone, and because it is where a code block declares its language. Second, the output only ever leaves through `renderHTML`'s escaping grammar; the sanitizer never assembles markup itself.

The floor is enforced from immutable state. The hard-banned schemes (`javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, `file:`) and the always-stripped attribute names (`on*`, `style`, `srcdoc`, `xmlns`) are fixed comparisons in the code, and every behavior-bearing collection — `UNSAFE_ELEMENTS` first among them — is a frozen array or a frozen record: `Object.freeze` on an array refuses `push`, `splice`, and index assignment, and the two keyed tables (`IMPLIED_CLOSERS`, `NAMED_ENTITIES`) are read as own properties only, so no entry can arrive through a prototype. Mutating an exported binding therefore cannot change what parsing, sanitizing, or rendering does. Every pass fails CLOSED: a thrown value anywhere in `sanitize` or `distill` yields safe output, never the untrusted original — and that includes the options themselves, since each allowlist is read and normalized INSIDE the boundary, so a hostile iterator or accessor on a collection you pass produces an empty document rather than an escaping error. Your own callbacks are the deliberate exception: `find`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `fold` let a handler's error propagate, because there is no honest generic value to substitute for behavior you authored, while `map` stays contained and preserves the document it started from. This is safety within this package's own serialization grammar — a guarantee about what `renderHTML` will re-emit — not a browser-native `TrustedHTML` substitute for a live DOM.

One more thing worth stating out loud: a URL sanitizer belongs to the output context it defends, and this one defends an AST that is about to be re-serialized. Three of its rules follow from that position rather than from the lower floor every URL sanitizer shares (strip every codepoint ≤ `U+0020` and `U+007F`–`U+009F`, refuse any two-character protocol-relative prefix drawn from `/` and `\`, extract an ASCII scheme, enforce an allowlist, keep relative / anchor / scheme-less values). First, `schemes` comes from the caller and REPLACES the default, so `javascript:` / `data:` / `vbscript:` / `file:` cannot be left to the allowlist and instead need the unwidenable refusal above, which no option can argue past. Second, the sanitized value is re-serialized and can be reparsed — and a hand-built AST can defer decoding to that later parse — so character references are decoded to a bounded fixpoint BEFORE the scheme is read: an obfuscated `https&colon;&sol;&sol;host` survives decoded while an obfuscated `javascript` does not. Third, `sanitizeURL` returns the raw survivor and lets `renderHTML` encode it later, which is why a kept `"` is not a hole: escaping is the serializer's job, one pass downstream, and doing it twice would corrupt the value.

The floor is enumerated as data rather than asserted case by case. `buildURLSafetyCorpus` in [`tests/setup.ts`](../tests/setup.ts) carries every vector with its disposition — control and whitespace splices, case variance, all four protocol-relative forms, kept relative / anchor / query URLs, refused schemes, entity obfuscation, unescaped survivors — and [`tests/src/core/helpers.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/helpers.test.ts) sweeps the whole list, checks that no group has silently disappeared from it, and then pins each of the three rules above with a named test instead of an absent assertion.

## The distill pass

`distill` is content extraction — a MECHANISM for reducing a page to its prose, with the policy in its option sets rather than baked in. It returns a pruned `HTMLInterface`, never a string: rendering stays a separate, downstream choice, which is what lets the same distilled document become HTML for a reader, plain text for a diff, or any projection a caller writes over the AST itself.

Four passes, in this order:

1. **Region and chrome prune.** Every `boilerplate` region is removed WITH its children (a navigation menu's link text is noise in every reading of the page), as is every element marked `hidden` or `aria-hidden="true"`.
2. **Sanitize with the DEFAULTS.** Distilling narrows content; it never widens the security floor, and it is not a second security surface with its own opinions.
3. **Re-root at the sole content region.** `REGION_ELEMENTS` is tried in order — `main`, then `article` — and a name qualifies only when it occurs EXACTLY once. Zero occurrences or several is ambiguous evidence, so the document is left whole rather than guessed at.
4. **Reduce to the content vocabulary.** Everything outside `elements` unwraps to its children; an attribute-free element whose only child is another element of the SAME name collapses into that child (`<ul><ul>…</ul></ul>` is one list); whitespace collapses to single spaces everywhere except inside `pre` and `code`, whose bodies stay exactly as written; an empty non-void element is dropped; comments and doctypes end here, being structure rather than content; and when `base` is given, every surviving URL attribute is resolved against it.

The hidden-content pass runs BEFORE the sanitize pass by necessity: `hidden` and `aria-hidden` are outside `SAFE_ATTRIBUTES`, so sanitizing first would consume the evidence stage 1 reads. Pruning more before the floor is applied can never admit anything the floor would have refused, which is why the order is safe as well as necessary.

Two honest details about `base`. It resolves what SURVIVES stage 2 — in practice `href` and `cite`, since a resource `src` has already been removed by the sanitize floor — and an unresolvable value is left exactly as written rather than dropped. `resolveAttributes` is exported for the caller who wants base resolution over an AST that never went through the floor.

Distilling is idempotent on its own output, and like every other operation here it returns a new handle and never touches the original.

## Text is the lossy projection

There are two renderers, and they are not equivalent. `renderHTML` is the structure-preserving one: canonical, reparsable, and — on a distilled document — the smallest form that still says which line was a heading and where a link pointed. `renderText` is the flat one. Blocks and `br` provide line boundaries, direct cells within a row use tabs, rows within a table use newlines, and text beneath `pre` keeps its source whitespace; other text whitespace collapses. What it still drops is worth naming instead of discovering:

| Structure                    | In `renderText`'s output                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `h1` … `h6`                  | A bare line, at no level — indistinguishable from a paragraph or a list item                                                                                             |
| `ul` / `ol` / `li`           | One line per block inside each item, with no marker, no ordinal, no nesting depth                                                                                        |
| `a`                          | The link TEXT only; the destination `base` just resolved is gone                                                                                                         |
| `img`                        | Nothing — `alt` text is an attribute, and attributes do not project                                                                                                      |
| `table` / `tr` / `th` / `td` | Tabs preserve direct cell positions, including empty cells, and newlines preserve rows; a `th` is indistinguishable from a `td`, and spans and attributes do not survive |
| `pre` / `code`               | Whitespace beneath `pre` stays verbatim; standalone `code` collapses normally; neither gains a fence or language marker                                                  |
| `blockquote`, `hr`           | Unmarked lines; an `hr` is a bare line boundary with no rule                                                                                                             |
| `strong` / `b`, `em` / `i`   | Their text, unmarked                                                                                                                                                     |

That table is the whole reason `distill` returns a handle. For a reader, a diff, or a summarizer that only needs prose, `renderText` is exactly right and cheaper than anything else here. For a consumer that reasons about structure — a language model asked which heading a passage sits under, or where a link goes — read the distilled AST directly, or serialize it with `renderHTML` and keep the structure the distiller worked to find. Choosing `renderText` there is choosing to throw that structure away.

## Relationship with `@orkestrel/contract`

The validation surface is a thin, purpose-built layer over `@orkestrel/contract`, the package's single runtime dependency (its own guide is mirrored at [`contract.md`](contract.md)):

- **Primitives, not copies.** `validators.ts` composes `recordOf` / `literalOf` / `arrayOf` and the primitive guards for the leaf shapes, and runs the recursive guard inside `attempt` so a hostile getter or a revoked proxy becomes `false` instead of a throw. Nothing here reimplements a declared primitive.
- **Leaf shapes and compiled contracts, in lockstep.** `shapers.ts` declares a `ContractShape` per non-recursive node; `factories.ts` compiles each through `createContract` into a `ContractInterface<T>` whose `schema`, `is`, `parse`, and `generate` all derive from that one declaration and therefore cannot drift.
- **Why the recursive nodes are guard-only.** A shape tree has no lazy or self-referential node — it is a finite, developer-authored tree a compiler can walk exhaustively. `ElementNode` and `HTMLDocument` recurse into `HTMLNode`, so they stay hand-written total guards with explicit ancestor tracking and a `MAX_DEPTH` bound: the recursion lives where it can be capped.

## Patterns

Every feature below has a compact, runnable example. Together they cover every `HTMLInterface` method, every standalone scanner, helper, and guard, and the contract-factory path.

### Parse, then query

```ts
import { createHTML, isElementNode } from '@orkestrel/html'

const page = createHTML('<h1>Title</h1><p>A <b>bold</b> word.</p>')

page.document.children[0] // { category: 'element', name: 'h1', attributes: [], children: [...] }
page.find(isElementNode)?.name // 'h1' - narrowed to ElementNode by the guard overload
page.filter(isElementNode).map((element) => element.name) // ['h1', 'p', 'b']

const categories: string[] = []
for (const node of page.walk()) categories.push(node.category)
// ['document', 'element', 'text', 'element', 'text', 'element', 'text', 'text']
```

### Adopt a document that came from somewhere else

```ts
import { HTML, isHTMLDocument, isHTMLNode } from '@orkestrel/html'

function adopt(candidate: unknown): HTML | undefined {
	if (!isHTMLDocument(candidate)) return undefined // total guard - never throws
	return new HTML(candidate) // adopted AS-IS, not re-validated
}

adopt({ category: 'document', children: [] }) // an HTML handle
adopt({ category: 'bogus' }) // undefined - rejected before any handle exists
isHTMLNode({ category: 'text', value: 'a & b' }) // true - one leaf, validated from unknown
```

### Rewrite with `map`, count with `reduce`, project with `fold`

```ts
import { createHTML, isTextNode, renderHTML } from '@orkestrel/html'
import type { HTMLHandlers } from '@orkestrel/html'

const page = createHTML('<h1>Title</h1><p>A <b>bold</b> word.</p>')

const shouted = page.map((node) =>
	node.category === 'text' ? { category: 'text', value: node.value.toUpperCase() } : node,
)
renderHTML(shouted.document) // '<h1>TITLE</h1><p>A <b>BOLD</b> WORD.</p>'
renderHTML(page.document) // '<h1>Title</h1><p>A <b>bold</b> word.</p>' - never mutated

page.reduce((total, node) => (isTextNode(node) ? total + node.value.length : total), 0) // 17

const elements: HTMLHandlers<number> = {
	document: (_, children) => children.reduce((total, value) => total + value, 0),
	element: (_, children) => 1 + children.reduce((total, value) => total + value, 0),
	text: () => 0,
	comment: () => 0,
	doctype: () => 0,
}
page.fold(elements) // 3
```

### Stream the top level, shallow and backpressured

```ts
import { createHTML } from '@orkestrel/html'

const page = createHTML('<h1>Title</h1><p>First.</p><p>Second.</p>')

// universal - a reader loop works in every ReadableStream-supporting environment
const reader = page.stream().getReader()
for (let result = await reader.read(); !result.done; result = await reader.read()) {
	result.value.category // 'element' - the root's direct children only
}

// Node / Deno / Firefox iterate a ReadableStream natively
for await (const node of page.stream()) node.category
```

### Sanitize, and watch the floor hold

```ts
import { createHTML, renderHTML, SAFE_ELEMENTS } from '@orkestrel/html'

const page = createHTML(
	'<div id="wrap"><p onclick="steal()">Hi <script>steal()</script>' +
		'<a href="javascript:alert(1)">bad</a></p><!-- note --></div>',
)

renderHTML(page.sanitize().document)
// '<div><p>Hi <a>bad</a></p></div>' - script gone whole, handler gone, dangerous href removed

renderHTML(page.sanitize({ comments: true }).document)
// '<div><p>Hi <a>bad</a></p><!-- note --></div>'

renderHTML(page.sanitize({ elements: new Set(['p']) }).document)
// '<p>Hi bad</p>' - div and a are safe but unlisted, so they unwrap to their content

// An allowlist is a Set or an array, so a frozen export needs no copy to be named explicitly.
renderHTML(page.sanitize({ elements: ['p'] }).document) // '<p>Hi bad</p>' - same as the Set above
renderHTML(page.sanitize({ elements: SAFE_ELEMENTS, comments: true }).document)
// '<div><p>Hi <a>bad</a></p><!-- note --></div>' - the default vocabulary, spelled out

const link = createHTML('<a href="/guide" onclick="steal()" title="Guide">g</a>')
renderHTML(link.sanitize({ attributes: new Set(['href', 'onclick']) }).document)
// '<a href="/guide">g</a>' - href kept, onclick still stripped: the floor is not an allowlist
```

### Distill a page down to its content

```ts
import { createHTML, renderHTML, renderText } from '@orkestrel/html'

// The string boundary: a scrape, a fetch, a fixture. `@orkestrel/browser` hands over
// page content the same way - a plain string plus the URL it came from.
const content = {
	html: '<nav>Menu</nav><main><h1>Title</h1><p>Read the <a href="/b">guide</a>.</p></main>',
	url: 'https://x.dev/docs/page',
}

const page = createHTML(content.html)

// Two shapes of output from one parse: the whole page made safe, or its content extracted.
const safe = page.sanitize()
const article = page.distill({ base: content.url }) // distill sanitizes internally, with the defaults

// Structure survives serialization: the heading is still a heading, the link still points.
renderHTML(article.document) // '<h1>Title</h1><p>Read the <a href="https://x.dev/b">guide</a>.</p>'

// Text does not: levels, markers, and destinations are gone, deliberately.
renderText(article.document) // 'Title\nRead the guide.'
renderText(safe.document) // 'Menu\nTitle\nRead the guide.'

// Policy is data: name the regions to drop and the vocabulary to keep, as a Set or an array.
const narrow = page.distill({ boilerplate: ['footer'], elements: new Set(['h1', 'p', 'a']) })
narrow.document.category // 'document' - always a handle, never a string
```

### Work on a bare node, with no handle at all

```ts
import {
	collapseText,
	extractRegion,
	foldNode,
	mergeText,
	parseDocument,
	pruneDocument,
	REGION_ELEMENTS,
	renderHTML,
	renderText,
	rewriteDocument,
	walkNodes,
} from '@orkestrel/html'
import type { HTMLHandlers } from '@orkestrel/html'

const document = parseDocument('<nav>x</nav><main><p>Keep<!-- drop --></p></main>')

const region = extractRegion(document, REGION_ELEMENTS) // re-rooted at the sole <main>
renderHTML(pruneDocument(region, (node) => (node.category === 'comment' ? [] : [node])))
// '<p>Keep</p>' - [] drops, node.children unwraps, [node] keeps

const lowered = rewriteDocument(document, (node) =>
	node.category === 'text' ? { category: 'text', value: node.value.toLowerCase() } : node,
)
renderText(lowered) // 'x\nkeep'

const categories = [...walkNodes(region)].map((node) => node.category)
// ['document', 'element', 'text', 'comment'] - depth-first, pre-order, root included

const leaves: HTMLHandlers<number> = {
	document: (_, children) => children.reduce((total, value) => total + value, 0),
	element: (_, children) => children.reduce((total, value) => total + value, 0),
	text: () => 1,
	comment: () => 1,
	doctype: () => 1,
}
foldNode(region, leaves) // 2

mergeText([
	{ category: 'text', value: 'a ' },
	{ category: 'text', value: 'b' },
]) // [{ category: 'text', value: 'a b' }] - the invariant an unwrap must restore
collapseText([{ category: 'text', value: ' a \n b ' }]) // [{ category: 'text', value: ' a b ' }]
```

### Scan by hand, one piece at a time

```ts
import {
	decodeEntities,
	isHTMLCodePoint,
	lowercaseASCII,
	parseStartTag,
	scanAttributes,
	scanComment,
	scanDoctype,
	scanRawText,
	scanTag,
} from '@orkestrel/html'

parseStartTag('<html lang="en" data-bs-theme="light">', 0)
// { name: 'html', attributes: [{ name: 'lang', value: 'en' }, { name: 'data-bs-theme', value: 'light' }], slashed: false, next: 38 }

parseStartTag('<html data-note="unterminated>', 0) // undefined — no recovery

scanTag('<IMG SRC="x.png" alt=hi />', 0)
// { name: 'img', attributes: [{ name: 'src', value: 'x.png' }, { name: 'alt', value: 'hi' }], closing: false, next: 26 }

scanAttributes(' HREF="/a" disabled href="/b"')
// [{ name: 'href', value: '/a' }, { name: 'disabled' }] - lowercased, first wins, valueless stays valueless

scanComment('<![CDATA[x]]>', 0) // { node: { category: 'comment', value: '[CDATA[x]]' }, next: 13 }
scanDoctype('<!DOCTYPE html>', 0) // { node: { category: 'doctype', name: 'html' }, next: 15 }
scanRawText('a < b</SCRIPT>tail', 0, 'script')
// { node: { category: 'text', value: 'a < b' }, next: 14, closed: true } - case-insensitive close

decodeEntities('a &amp; b &#169; c &bogus;') // 'a & b © c &bogus;' - unknown names stay literal
lowercaseASCII('HTML-Ω') // 'html-Ω' - Unicode is preserved
isHTMLCodePoint(0x1f600) // true
isHTMLCodePoint(0xd800) // false - surrogate
```

### Escape, resolve, and inspect

```ts
import {
	attributeOf,
	collapseSpace,
	encodeAttribute,
	encodeText,
	parseDocument,
	resolveAttributes,
	resolveURL,
	SAFE_ATTRIBUTES,
	SAFE_URL_SCHEMES,
	sanitizeAttributes,
	sanitizeURL,
} from '@orkestrel/html'

encodeText('a & b < c') // 'a &amp; b &lt; c'
encodeAttribute('a "b" & c') // 'a &quot;b&quot; &amp; c'
collapseSpace('  a \n\t b  ') // 'a b'

sanitizeURL('java&#115;cript:alert(1)', SAFE_URL_SCHEMES) // '' - decoded first, then refused
sanitizeURL('/docs/page', SAFE_URL_SCHEMES) // '/docs/page' - relative is always allowed
resolveURL('../a', 'https://x.dev/docs/page') // 'https://x.dev/a'

const anchor = parseDocument('<a href="javascript:alert(1)" title="Home" onclick="x()">t</a>')
	.children[0]
if (anchor?.category === 'element') {
	attributeOf(anchor, 'TITLE') // 'Home' - case-insensitive; '' would mean present-but-valueless
	sanitizeAttributes(anchor, SAFE_ATTRIBUTES, SAFE_URL_SCHEMES) // [{ name: 'title', value: 'Home' }]
	resolveAttributes(anchor, 'https://x.dev/docs/') // href resolved, other names lowercased
}
```

### Ask a name or an element a question

```ts
import {
	isBlockElement,
	isEmptyElement,
	isLiteralElement,
	isRawElement,
	isSafeURL,
	isVoidElement,
	parseDocument,
} from '@orkestrel/html'

isVoidElement('BR') // true - case-insensitive, derived from the name, never stored
isRawElement('script') // true
isLiteralElement('title') // true
isBlockElement('p') // true

isSafeURL('/a') // true - relative
isSafeURL('javascript:x') // false - refused whatever the scheme set says
isSafeURL('ftp://x.dev', new Set(['ftp'])) // true - a caller may widen the safe schemes

const image = parseDocument('<img src="a.png" alt="A">').children[0]
if (image?.category === 'element') isEmptyElement(image) // true
```

### Prove the roundtrip laws

```ts
import { createHTML, parseDocument, renderHTML } from '@orkestrel/html'

const page = createHTML('<P CLASS=a>x<BR/></P>')

renderHTML(page.document) // '<p class="a">x<br></p>' - canonical, not byte-identical to the input

// 1. AST fixpoint: reparsing what the renderer wrote returns the same AST.
parseDocument(renderHTML(page.document)) // deep-equals page.document

// 2. Canonical idempotence: rendering that reparse returns the same string.
renderHTML(parseDocument(renderHTML(page.document))) === renderHTML(page.document) // true

// 3. Sanitize fixpoint - directly, and through a reparse of its own output.
const clean = page.sanitize().document
renderHTML(createHTML(clean).sanitize().document) === renderHTML(clean) // true
renderHTML(createHTML(renderHTML(clean)).sanitize().document) === renderHTML(clean) // true
```

### Generate fixtures from a compiled contract

```ts
import {
	createAttributeContract,
	createCommentContract,
	createDoctypeContract,
	createTextContract,
} from '@orkestrel/html'
import { seededRandom } from '@orkestrel/contract'

const attribute = createAttributeContract()
attribute.schema // the compiled JSON Schema for HTMLAttribute
attribute.is({ name: 'href', value: '/guide' }) // true
attribute.is({ name: 'disabled' }) // true - a valueless attribute is valid
attribute.parse({ name: 'href' }) // { name: 'href' }

const text = createTextContract()
const fixture = text.generate(seededRandom(42)) // reproducible seed data
text.is(fixture) // true - guard and generator stay in lockstep

createCommentContract().is({ category: 'comment', value: ' note ' }) // true
createDoctypeContract().is({ category: 'doctype', name: 'html' }) // true
```

## Tests

- [`tests/src/core/parsers.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/parsers.test.ts) — the whole recovery table row by row, entity decoding, and a hostile corpus proving totality, the no-adjacent-text invariant, and guard soundness on 100,000-tag floods.
- [`tests/src/core/validators.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/validators.test.ts) — the from-unknown leaf and recursive guards (cycles, hostile getters, revoked proxies, excessive depth, the void-element invariant) and the element/URL predicates.
- [`tests/src/core/helpers.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/helpers.test.ts) — ASCII case folding, entity decoding, the escaping, URL, attribute, and text leaves; every exported recovering scanner and the strict start-tag source boundaries with their hostile refusals; `mergeText` / `collapseText` / `extractRegion` / `pruneDocument`; both renderers including the hand-built-AST refusals; and the AST fixpoint and canonical idempotence laws.
- [`tests/src/core/HTML.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/HTML.test.ts) — construction and adoption, `walk` / `find` / `filter` / `map` / `reduce` / `fold` / `stream`, the sanitize floor and its laws against an adversarial corpus, and every stage of the distill pass including its idempotence.
- [`tests/src/core/shapers.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/shapers.test.ts) — per-shape guard exactness, closed JSON Schemas, seeded generation, parse rebuilds, and `Infer` ↔ interface parity in both directions.
- [`tests/src/core/factories.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/factories.test.ts) — `createHTML` against the class it constructs, and the four compiled node contracts.
