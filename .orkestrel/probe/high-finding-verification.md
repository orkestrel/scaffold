# Independent verification of the high-severity sweep findings

Each finding was handed to a verifier told to reproduce it with an executed measurement or refute
it, and told that `UNPROVEN` is a real answer and a correction is worth as much as a confirmation.

## [REPRODUCED] severity high — Vitest worker stdout is piped into the same process.stdout that frames JSON-RPC, so a claim whose test writes to file descriptor 1 corrupts the MCP response stream of /tmp/probe-audit3/dist/bin/main.js.

**Evidence.** MECHANISM (source, both in the checked-out tree and in the built artifact that actually ran):
- /tmp/probe-audit3/src/server/stages/RuntimeStage.ts:102 and its build at /tmp/probe-audit3/dist/src/server/index.js:499 call `createVitest("test", { ... })` with two arguments.
- Installed declaration /tmp/probe-audit3/node_modules/vitest/dist/node.d.ts:125: `declare function createVitest(mode: VitestRunMode, options: CliOptions, viteOverrides?: UserConfig$1, vitestOptions?: VitestOptions)`. `VitestOptions` (node_modules/vitest/dist/chunks/reporters.d.DtoKVV2s.d.ts:1216-1221) is `{ packageInstaller?; stdin?; stdout?: NodeJS.WriteStream | Writable; stderr?: ... }`. It is unset.
- Unset means the default: node_modules/vitest/dist/chunks/cli-api.CnMVyzaz.js:1883 `constructor(ctx, outputStream = process.stdout, errorStream = process.stderr)`.
- node_modules/vitest/dist/chunks/cli-api.CnMVyzaz.js:1871-1237ff `ThreadsPoolWorker`: `this.stdout = options.project.vitest.logger.outputStream`, then `start()` builds `new Worker(entrypoint, { ..., stdout: true, stderr: true })` and `this._thread.stdout.pipe(this.stdout)`. A worker's raw fd-1 bytes therefore land on the host's process.stdout — the stream `createStdioServer` frames newline-delimited JSON-RPC on.

EXECUTED RUN 1 — command: `cd /tmp/probe-audit3 && node <driver>.mjs`, driver spawns `node /tmp/probe-audit3/dist/bin/main.js` with cwd /tmp/probe-audit3, stdio pipe, sends `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, then `tools/call` of `prove` with project `tsconfig.json`, case `{files:[], test:{path:'tmp/probe/v-stdout-case.test.ts', text: "import { expect, test } from 'vitest'\ntest('writes to stdout', () => {\n\tprocess.stdout.write('XCORRUPTX')\n\texpect(1).toBe(1)\n})\n"}}`, control the same shape failing at `runtime`.
Raw child stdout, verbatim (JSON.stringify of the captured buffer, truncated at the response body):
"{\"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"result\":{\"capabilities\":{\"tools\":{}},\"protocolVersion\":\"2025-11-25\",\"serverInfo\":{\"name\":\"probe\",\"version\":\"0.0.1\"}}}\nXCORRUPTX{\"id\":2,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"result\":{\"content\":[{\"text\":\"probe 39a3e852-... (616 ms)\\n...receipt probe:39a3e852-...:runtime:typescript@6.0.3:oxlint@1.79.0:vitest@4.1.11\",\"type\":\"text\"}]}}\n"
Per-line parse:
  line 0: VALID-JSON | len=142
  line 1: NOT-JSON (Unexpected token 'X', "XCORRUPTX{"... is not valid JSON) | len=583 | containsMark=true
The corrupted line is the answer to the client's own `tools/call` id 2, and the verdict inside it is fully green and carries a receipt. The corruption rides a successful response, not an error path.

EXECUTED RUN 2 (blast-radius characterization) — same driver, case test body changed to `console.log('CONSOLEMARK')` + `process.stderr.write('STDERRMARK')` + `process.stdout.write('XCORRUPTX-A\nSPURIOUSLINE\n')`. Wall time 9.3 s.
Raw stdout per-line parse:
  line 0: VALID-JSON | len=142   (initialize response)
  line 1: NOT-JSON (Unexpected token 'X', "XCORRUPTX-A" is not valid JSON) | len=11
  line 2: NOT-JSON (Unexpected token 'S', "SPURIOUSLINE" is not valid JSON) | len=12
  line 3: VALID-JSON | len=575   (tools/call response, intact)
Child stderr captured: `STDERRMARK`. `CONSOLEMARK` appeared on neither stream.

Both runs left the worktree clean (`git status --porcelain` shows only the pre-existing untracked ROUND3.diff and u4a-last.md; tmp/probe/ holds only another verifier's file), and `ps` shows no leaked oxlint, vitest, or main.js process.

**Correction to the claim.** The defect is real and at least as large as claimed, with three refinements the claim did not state.

1. Two distinct failure modes, selected by whether the test's write ends in a newline. A write with no trailing newline PREFIXES the next protocol line and makes that line unparseable — run 1 destroyed the client's own `tools/call` response. A write ending in a newline instead INJECTS whole spurious non-JSON lines between responses — run 2 left the response intact but fed the client two garbage lines. Both break a newline-delimited JSON-RPC client; only the first loses a response.

2. The escape is raw fd-1 writes, not test logging in general. `console.log` from the worker was swallowed: Vitest intercepts `console` in the worker and RPCs it to `onUserConsoleLog`, which the stage's custom reporter (RuntimeStage.ts:108-113, only `onInit` and `onTestRunEnd`) does not implement. So the common form of test output is already contained, and the exposure is `process.stdout.write`, `process.stdout.fd` writes, and any child process a test spawns with inherited stdio. That narrows how often this fires accidentally, and does not narrow the hostile case at all.

3. Severity is higher than "corrupts a response". Because the client parses per line, a claim's test can emit arbitrary well-formed JSON-RPC lines onto the server-to-client stream — a fabricated result for an id the client is waiting on, or a fabricated notification. A claim is untrusted input to this service, so this is response forgery over the transport, not only noise. Run 2 proves injected lines survive the transport intact and are delimited exactly as real ones are.

Not affected: the lint stage. `src/server/stages/LintStage.ts:101-103` spawns oxlint with `stdio: 'pipe'`, so it cannot reach the host's stdout. The type stage is in-process and writes nothing.

Also observed but outside the framing defect: worker stderr reaches the host's stderr verbatim (`STDERRMARK`). Harmless to JSON-RPC framing, still a leak into the host's diagnostics.

**Repair direction.** Pass the fourth `createVitest` argument at src/server/stages/RuntimeStage.ts:102 and bind both streams away from the transport: `createVitest('test', { ... }, undefined, { stdout, stderr })`, where `stdout` is a `node:stream` `Writable` the transport never uses. Discarding is acceptable because the stage's reporter already ignores console output; forwarding to `process.stderr` preserves the operator's view of a noisy test without touching fd 1. Do not fix this by patching `process.stdout.write` in the host — the worker's bytes arrive through `worker.stdout.pipe(logger.outputStream)`, so the only seam that closes it is the stream Vitest's `Logger` is constructed with.

Guard it with a proof that would have failed before the change: drive the built `dist/bin/main.js` as a child process over newline-delimited JSON-RPC, send a `prove` whose case test executes `process.stdout.write('XCORRUPTX')`, and assert that every non-empty line of the child's stdout parses as JSON and that no line contains the marker. Cover both variants — a write with a trailing newline and one without — because they fail differently and a test covering only one passes against a half fix. `tests/src/bin/main.test.ts` currently only reads the entry's source and states that driving the running entry belongs to a proof that can own a spawned child; this is that proof.

## [REPRODUCED] severity medium — RuntimeStage's per-run eviction removes nothing from the resident Vitest's retained state. `src/server/stages/RuntimeStage.ts:142-149` calls `vitest.state.clearFiles(project, [file])`, `vitest.clearSpecificationsCache(file)`, and `vitest.invalidateFile(file)` in its `finally`. Only `clearSpecificationsCache` deletes a key. Because every inspection writes a fresh revision file named with `randomUUID()`, each inspection permanently adds one key to `state.filesMap`, one node to each project environment's Vite module graph, and one entry per task to `state.idMap`. Growth is exactly linear in the number of inspections, with no flattening and no release.

**Evidence.** INSTRUMENT. Scripts under /tmp/probe-audit3/tmp/probe/v-evict-*.mjs (deleted after the runs), each importing `RuntimeStage` from /tmp/probe-audit3/dist/src/server/index.js against workspace /tmp/probe-audit3 with `test.path` under `tmp/probe/`, which `inferTestProject` routes to the `probe` Vitest project. The stage's Vitest instance is private (`#vitest`), so the script created one throwaway Vitest with `createVitest`, closed it, took `Object.getPrototypeOf(throwaway)`, and patched `runTestSpecifications` on that shared prototype to capture `this` — the real stage's own instance. Every run destroyed the stage in a `finally`.

MEASUREMENT A — growth curve, 30 inspections, real stage, distinct test text each time, one declared path (`tmp/probe/v-evict-long.test.ts`), one test per file, `globalThis.gc()` before each heap reading. Command: `node --expose-gc tmp/probe/v-evict-long.mjs`. First and last rows, with the intermediate 28 rows exactly on the same line:
  {"i":1,"idMap":2,"filesMap":1,"graph":3,"heapMB":26.99}
  {"i":10,"idMap":20,"filesMap":10,"graph":12,"heapMB":27.92}
  {"i":20,"idMap":40,"filesMap":20,"graph":22,"heapMB":28.03}
  {"i":30,"idMap":60,"filesMap":30,"graph":32,"heapMB":28.09}
Per inspection: idMap +2, filesMap +1, module graph +1, heap +0.038 MB. Linear across all 30 points.

MEASUREMENT B — per-call attribution, 6 inspections, wrapping `StateManager.prototype.clearFiles`, `Vitest.prototype.clearSpecificationsCache`, and `Vitest.prototype.invalidateFile` to snapshot sizes before and after each call, filtered to the revision path. Command: `node tmp/probe/v-evict-mechanism.mjs`. Every inspection produced the identical three rows:
  {"call":"state.clearFiles","delta":{"idMap":0,"filesMap":0,"specCache":0,"graphIds":0}}
  {"call":"clearSpecificationsCache","delta":{"idMap":0,"filesMap":0,"specCache":-1,"graphIds":0}}
  {"call":"invalidateFile","delta":{"idMap":0,"filesMap":0,"specCache":0,"graphIds":0},"nodesBefore":[1],"nodesAfter":[1]}
`clearFiles` nets zero. `invalidateFile` leaves the module node in place — `getModulesByFile` returns one node before and one after. `clearSpecificationsCache` is the only call that deletes anything.

MEASUREMENT C — scaling with task count, 5 inspections of a file with 2 describes and 6 tests. Command: `node tmp/probe/v-evict-shape.mjs`.
  {"i":2,"idMap":18,"filesMap":2,"idMapDelta":9,"filesMapDelta":1}
  {"i":5,"idMap":45,"filesMap":5,"idMapDelta":9,"filesMapDelta":1}
idMap grows by 1 + suites + tests per inspection (9 = 1 file + 2 suites + 6 tests), not by one entry.

MEASUREMENT D — repair proof, 12 inspections with an explicit key sweep applied after each. Command: `node tmp/probe/v-evict-fix.mjs`. Identical row every iteration:
  {"i":12,"findings":0,"before":{"idMap":2,"filesMap":1,"graph":3},"after":{"idMap":0,"filesMap":0,"graph":2}}
The curve is flat, and all 12 inspections still returned 0 findings, so the extra eviction does not break the runs.

SOURCE CORROBORATION (Vitest 4.1.11, /tmp/probe-audit3/node_modules/vitest/dist/chunks/cli-api.CnMVyzaz.js):
  L12085 `clearFiles(project, paths)` builds `createFileTask$1(path, ...)`, calls `this.idMap.set(fileTask.id, fileTask)` and `this.filesMap.set(path, [fileTask])`. It deletes nothing, and it does not touch the child suite and test ids that `collectFiles` -> `updateId` put in `idMap`.
  L13597 `clearSpecificationsCache(moduleId)` -> L11535 `this._cachedSpecs.delete(moduleId)`.
  L13966 `invalidateFile(filepath)` calls `moduleGraph.invalidateModule(module)`; Vite 8.2.1 `invalidateModule` (node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/node.js:34757) clears `transformResult`, `ssrModule`, and the etag entry, and removes nothing from `idToModuleMap`, `urlToModuleMap`, or `fileToModulesMap`.

BLAST RADIUS. `src/server/Probe.ts:70` builds one `RuntimeStage` at construction, and `#recycle` (L230-249) replaces it only from the `catch` in `#inspectRuntime` when the deadline expired. There is no periodic recycling, so the stage and its Vitest live for the process. Each `prove` runs the case and the control through the runtime stage, so a resident service accumulates two inspections' worth of state per proof.

**Correction to the claim.** The claim is right about the mechanism and understates the magnitude in one dimension. `filesMap` and the Vite module graph grow by exactly one entry per inspection, as claimed. `state.idMap` grows by 1 + suites + tests per inspection, not by one: measured +2 for a single-test file, +4 for one describe with two tests, +9 for two describes with six tests. Two further precisions. First, `clearFiles` is not merely inert — it re-registers a placeholder file task under the same key, so the map key survives even though the collected result is dropped; the child suite and test ids from the run are never touched at all. Second, the stage's own fields are clean: `#revisions` is deleted per run and `#modules` is bounded by the workspace file count, so the entire leak lives inside the retained Vitest instance. On absolute size, the per-inspection cost is small — 0.038 MB of post-GC heap for a one-test file, roughly 26,000 inspections per gigabyte — so this is unbounded growth in a resident service rather than a near-term crash. That is why the severity is medium and not high. The stage's own TSDoc at RuntimeStage.ts:22-24 states each inspection "evicts its result", which the measurement shows it does not.

**Repair direction.** Evict by the revision path directly instead of relying on `clearFiles` and `invalidateFile`. Keep `vitest.clearSpecificationsCache(file)` — it is the one call that works — and replace the other two with explicit deletion: `vitest.state.filesMap.delete(file)`; delete every `vitest.state.idMap` entry whose task resolves to `file` (`task.file?.filepath ?? task.filepath`); and for each `project.vite.environments` entry delete the module from `moduleGraph.idToModuleMap`, `moduleGraph.urlToModuleMap`, and `moduleGraph.fileToModulesMap`. Measurement D ran exactly that sweep across 12 inspections and held every counter flat with findings still correct.

Two warnings for whoever implements it. Vite 8.2.1's `EnvironmentModuleGraph.onFileDelete(file)` looks like the supported answer and is not: node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/node.js:34749-34756 only detaches importer back-references and deletes no map entry. And the sweep above reaches into Vite internals, which `AGENTS.md` would flag; if that is unacceptable, the alternative repair is to bound the stage's lifetime instead — reuse a stable revision path per declared test so each inspection overwrites one key rather than minting a new one, or extend `Probe.#recycle` to replace the stage after a fixed inspection count rather than only on a deadline expiry. Whichever route is taken, the acceptance criterion is the flat curve: run 30 inspections and show `state.idMap.size`, `state.filesMap.size`, and the summed `moduleGraph.idToModuleMap.size` returning to the same value after each one.

## [REPRODUCED] severity high — TypeStage applies candidate-source overlays before the try whose finally clears them, so a case whose `files` contain a good path followed by a workspace-escaping path pins an attacker-chosen in-memory copy of a real workspace file on the resident stage.

**Evidence.** Code, /tmp/probe-audit3/src/server/stages/TypeStage.ts lines 148-170: `this.#overlay(subject.test)` and `for (const source of subject.files) this.#overlay(source)` run BEFORE `try {`; the `finally` that deletes those overlay keys is attached only to the block that follows. `#overlay` (line 172) calls `resolveWorkspaceFile`, which throws `Path escapes the workspace: <target>` (/tmp/probe-audit3/src/server/helpers.ts lines 15-23). A throw from the second overlay therefore leaves the first overlay installed with no clearing path.

Executed measurement. Script (since deleted) at /tmp/probe-audit3/tmp/probe/v-overlay-check.mjs imported `TypeStage` from /tmp/probe-audit3/dist/src/server/index.js against workspace /tmp/probe-audit3, using the real file `src/core/constants.ts` and a virtual reader `src/core/vOverlayReader.ts` whose text is `import { PROBE_STAGES } from './constants.js'` / `export const VOVERLAY_COUNT: number = PROBE_STAGES.length`.

Command: `cd /tmp/probe-audit3 && timeout 110 node tmp/probe/v-overlay-check.mjs`
Output (verbatim):
A baseline (clean stage, reader imports REAL from disk): []
B poison case (REAL overlaid, then a bad path) threw: "Path escapes the workspace: ../v-overlay-escape.ts"
C after poison (reader alone; REAL not in files): ["src/core/vOverlayReader.ts:1 Module '\"./constants.js\"' has no exported member 'PROBE_STAGES'."]
D again (same case, second later inspection): ["src/core/vOverlayReader.ts:1 Module '\"./constants.js\"' has no exported member 'PROBE_STAGES'."]
DISK still real: "import type { Stage } from './types.js'"
E control (REAL overlaid, no bad path): []
F after control (reader alone): []
EXIT=0

Reading: step B's case was `files: [{ path: 'src/core/constants.ts', text: 'export const VOVERLAY_POISON = 1\n' }, { path: '../v-overlay-escape.ts', text: '' }]`. The first overlay landed, the second threw, and no finally ran. Steps C and D are ordinary later inspections that do not name `src/core/constants.ts` at all, yet the type stage now reads the poison text for that real file — the disk file is untouched (`DISK still real`). Step E is the control: the identical poison overlay with the bad path removed reaches the finally, and F confirms the stage is clean again, so the leak is caused by the overlay sitting outside the try and nothing else.

Reachability (read, not executed): `isSource`/`SOURCE_SHAPE` constrain `path` only to a non-empty string (/tmp/probe-audit3/src/core/validators.ts line 52, /tmp/probe-audit3/src/core/shapers.ts line 18) — no containment check exists before the stage. `Probe.prove` (/tmp/probe-audit3/src/server/Probe.ts lines 86-109) emits and rethrows the error and does not destroy the probe, so the poisoned resident TypeStage survives the failed claim and serves every later claim in that process.

**Correction to the claim.** Two refinements to the claim, neither of which weakens it.

1. The pin is not merely "stale": the overlay text is supplied by the caller, so the type stage serves an attacker-chosen body for a real workspace file. A later claim can be made to pass or fail against text that is not on disk, which defeats the receipt's premise.

2. "For the life of the process" holds with one escape hatch the claim does not mention: the entry is also removed when a later case includes that exact path and completes normally, because that case's finally deletes it (steps E and F above). Absent such a case, or a `destroy`, it persists indefinitely.

Trigger precision: the bad path must follow at least one good overlay. A case whose only bad path is `test` pins nothing, because `test` is overlaid first. Any path `resolveWorkspaceFile` rejects works — `../x.ts` or an absolute path.

**Repair direction.** Move both overlay applications inside the try, and make the finally clear exactly what was applied rather than re-deriving keys from `subject`.

The straightforward move alone is not sufficient: the current finally re-calls `resolveWorkspaceFile(this.#workspace, source.path)` for every source (lines 165-168), so a bad path in the middle of `files` would throw inside the finally and leave every later source pinned. Collect the resolved paths as they are applied — for example `const applied: string[] = []` outside the try, `applied.push(path)` from `#overlay`'s resolution, and `for (const path of applied) this.#overlays.delete(path)` plus the matching `#versions.delete(path)` in the finally — so clearing cannot itself throw.

Note that `#versions` is never cleared by the current finally either; the entry survives every inspection until `destroy`. That is presently harmless because `#version` consults `#overlays.has(file)` first, but it grows unbounded per distinct path and should be deleted alongside the overlay.

Separately, reject a path that escapes the workspace at admission (`isSource` / `SOURCE_SHAPE`) so a malformed claim is refused at the wire rather than part-way through a stage.

## [CONFIRMED, sharper than reported] severity high (doc-truth) — The canonical `Claim` @example declares a negative control byte-identical to the case, so it can never yield a receipt

Settled by the Orchestrator by inspection, 2026-08-19. This claim is a property of static text, so
reading the text is the measurement rather than a substitute for one.

**Evidence.** `src/core/types.ts` lines 94-102:

```text
 * const greeting: Source = { path: 'src/core/greeting.ts', text: 'export const GREETING = "hi"\n' }
 * const test: Source = { path: 'tests/src/core/greeting.test.ts', text: 'test("greets", () => {})\n' }
 * const claim: Claim = {
 * 	project: 'configs/src/tsconfig.core.json',
 * 	case: { files: [greeting], test },
 * 	control: { files: [greeting], test, stage: 'type', reason: 'the control must not compile' },
 * }
```

`case.files` and `control.files` are the same binding. `case.test` and `control.test` are the same
binding. The control declares `stage: 'type'` and `reason: 'the control must not compile'`, and the
text it names is `export const GREETING = "hi"`, which compiles. `computeReceipt` issues only when
every case check is clean AND the control failed at its declared stage, so this claim can never earn
a receipt: the control passes the type stage it names.

**Correction to the claim.** The finding is right and understates itself in two ways.

1. The example is not merely unable to yield a receipt. It is the flagship example on `Claim`, the
   package's central type, so it is the shape a first consumer copies. A consumer who copies it gets
   a refusal with no receipt and no indication that the example, rather than their code, is what is
   wrong.

2. The same file gets it right one interface earlier. The `Control` @example at lines 70-75 uses
   `'export const GREETING: number = "hi"\n'` — a string literal assigned to `number`, which
   genuinely fails the type stage it names. So the correct control text exists in the file, 20 lines
   above the example that drops it. That rules out "the author did not know what a control is" and
   makes this a transcription defect, which is the kind a reader is least likely to catch.

**Repair direction.** Give the `Claim` example its own control source with the failing text the
`Control` example already uses, rather than reusing the `greeting` binding. The fix is three lines and
belongs with the unit that owns `src/core/types.ts`.

Under `.claude/rules/documentation.md` the guide proof executes flagship fences. This fence is TSDoc
rather than a guide fence, so `tests/guides.test.ts` does not reach it. Whoever repairs it states
whether the same claim is made in `guides/` and repairs both.

## [PARTLY CLOSED BY UNIT 4A] severity high (doc-truth) — `CLAIM_SHAPE` claims the tool admits calls with `compileGuard(CLAIM_SHAPE)`; it admits them with `isClaim`

Settled by the Orchestrator by inspection, 2026-08-19.

**Evidence.** The finding has two halves and they are now in different states.

The binding half was true when the sweep ran and unit 4a closed it. `tests/src/core/validators.test.ts`
line 74 now calls `compileGuard(CLAIM_SHAPE)` and asserts `isClaim` agrees with it over a named
hostile population, so the guarantee at `src/core/validators.ts` line 98 — "Admits and refuses exactly
what `compileGuard(CLAIM_SHAPE)` does" — is now proven rather than asserted.

The doc half stands. `src/core/shapers.ts` line 68 says the tool "admits a call with
`compileGuard(CLAIM_SHAPE)`". `src/server/factories.ts` line 65 admits with `isClaim(input)`.
`compileGuard` has no call site in `src/` at all — every occurrence there is inside a doc comment.
The sentence describes a mechanism the server does not use.

**Correction to the claim.** "compileGuard is never called in the package" was true at sweep time and
is now false: unit 4a's test calls it. Nothing about the finding's substance changes, because the
finding's subject is the sentence in `shapers.ts`, and that sentence is still false about the server.

**Repair direction.** Rewrite the `shapers.ts` remark to say what is true and now proven: the tool
publishes `compileSchema(CLAIM_SHAPE)` and admits with `isClaim`, which a test holds to
`compileGuard(CLAIM_SHAPE)`'s exact behavior. That keeps the anti-drift guarantee the remark is for
and stops claiming a call path that does not exist.

## [REPRODUCED] severity high (failure-paths) — The lint stage reads liveness from `exitCode` alone, so a signal-killed Oxlint server makes `prove` and `destroy` hang forever

Reproduced by the Orchestrator with an executed probe and a discriminating negative control,
2026-08-19. Instrument: `scratchpad/liveness.mjs`, transcribed into `instruments/liveness.mjs`.

**Evidence.** Output verbatim:

```text
exit event      code=null signal=SIGKILL
child.exitCode  = null
child.signalCode= SIGKILL
GUARD exitCode !== null => false (false means the guard reads a dead child as alive)
write after death threw = false
CONTROL clean exit: exitCode = 3 signalCode = null
CONTROL guard exitCode !== null => true (must be true, or the guard never works at all)
```

**What the control establishes.** The control is drawn from outside the population the finding covers:
an ordinary `process.exit(3)` rather than a signal death. It reports `exitCode = 3`, so the guard
returns true and correctly detects that death. That is what makes the signal result a finding rather
than a broken guard — the guard works, and it works only for the exit path. A control that had also
returned null would have meant the probe was measuring nothing.

**The second line matters as much as the first.** `child.stdin.write(...)` after the child is dead
returns without throwing. So the guard at `LintStage.ts:198` is not one of two defenses, it is the
only one. When it reads false, the write silently succeeds against a dead pipe, no reply ever arrives,
and nothing settles the promise.

**Confirms the finding as written.** `src/server/stages/LintStage.ts` has exactly two liveness reads,
at line 89 (`#destroy`) and line 198 (`#send`), and `grep -n 'exitCode|killed|signalCode' ` returns
only those two plus nothing else. Both use the `exitCode !== null` form the probe just falsified.

**Repair direction.** Read liveness from both fields — a child is dead when `exitCode !== null` OR
`signalCode !== null` — or better, hold an explicit boolean the `exit` handler sets, so liveness is
one derived fact rather than two Node fields every call site has to remember to check. `#exit` already
knows the difference: it formats `signal ${signal}` when `code === null`.

## Coverage of this file

Five of the ten HIGH findings are settled with executed evidence: the stdout corruption, the runtime
eviction, the type-stage overlay pin, the skipped-test receipt (recorded in
`seam-sweep-findings.md` under `Orchestrator verification`), and the type stage's inability to
resolve a candidate file that is not on disk (measured in full as O9, recorded in
`o9-reconciliation.md`). The two doc-truth findings above are settled by inspection, which is the
matching instrument for a claim about static text.

Two HIGH findings are NOT independently reproduced and are carried into their repair units on the
sweep's own evidence alone:

- the deadline armed before the inspection is queued (unit S2),
- the lint stage's orphaned document promise ending the host (unit S3).

The lint stage's `exitCode` liveness read was the third and is now reproduced, immediately preceding
this section.

Each is behavioral and needs an executed reproduction. Unit S3 owns one of the two and produces
that reproduction as its own failing proof before repairing, per the regression-proof law. Do not
read this file as covering all ten.
