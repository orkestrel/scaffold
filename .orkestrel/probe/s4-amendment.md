# Unit S4 — amendment 1, written 2026-08-19 after Q1 landed

`s4-brief.md` stands. This file records what moved between writing it and dispatching it. Read both.

## The line numbers moved by roughly 64 lines

Unit Q1 replaced the three per-stage `#tail` serializers with one `QueueInterface` owned by `Probe`, and
folded each stage's private `#inspect` into its public `inspect`. `TypeStage.ts` is 264 lines now.

The brief quotes defect A at `src/server/stages/TypeStage.ts:148-169`. Verified against the file at
commit `e11c389`, the same code is at **84-105**:

```text
84:		this.#revision += 1
85:		this.#overlay(subject.test)
86:		for (const source of subject.files) this.#overlay(source)
87:		try {
101:		} finally {
102:			this.#overlays.delete(resolveWorkspaceFile(this.#workspace, subject.test.path))
104:				this.#overlays.delete(resolveWorkspaceFile(this.#workspace, source.path))
```

`#overlay` is at 162. The defect is byte-for-byte what the brief describes — two overlay applications
outside the `try` whose `finally` removes them. Re-read the file for exact positions rather than
trusting either set of numbers.

## The engine is unchanged

`sol` — GPT-5.6 Sol. This unit's subject is a TypeScript language-service overlay map, not a spawned
child's stdio, so the nested-spawn constraint that re-routed S3 does not reach it. Confirm the bench is
live with a round-tripped call before launching; a version string and an authentication check are not
liveness.

## The dispatch order changed

S4 runs AFTER S3, not beside it. Both are writers and the contract serializes writers in the main
checkout. S3 owns `LintStage.ts`; S4 owns `TypeStage.ts`; they are disjoint files and the rule still
binds, because a concurrent tree-wide gate reads a sibling's in-flight failure.

The test-helper adoption unit runs after BOTH. It sweeps `tests/src/server/stages/TypeStage.test.ts`,
which S4 edits, so it must see S4's final shape rather than repair the same drift the other way.
