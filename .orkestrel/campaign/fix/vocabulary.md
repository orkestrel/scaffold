From `.claude/rules/names.md` § Standalone helpers (scaffold, landed 2026-09-01, fix round applied):

- A helper prefix has one project-wide meaning:
  - `extract*` extracts structure.
  - `infer*` derives.
  - `compute*` calculates deterministically.
  - `matches*` is a predicate.
  - `build*` constructs a plain composite value (a record, a row, a worksheet) from parts and reads no host; an entity factory is `create*` and a combinator named for its constituents is `*Of`, both in § Fixed derivation/construction forms.
  - `read*` obtains a value from a live host object, a stream position, or a byte layout, returns it or throws, and never coerces; a coercing helper is `parse*` in § Fixed derivation/construction forms.
  - `resolve*` picks the effective value from options and defaults.
  - `scan*` walks a structure and returns its findings.
  - `describe*` takes a finding and returns the human-readable message that names it.
  - `normalize*` returns the canonical form of a value of the same type.
  - `collect*` gathers members into a collection.
  - `render*` produces text or markup from a value that is not a finding.
  - `supports*` is a capability predicate and narrows no type.

From § General vocabulary:

- An option key, constant, or member that transliterates an external protocol field, format field, or engine pragma keeps the external wording in this project's casing, and its TSDoc names the source it mirrors: the `foreignKeys` key mirrors the `PRAGMA foreign_keys` statement, and the `keepAlive` key mirrors the Ollama `keep_alive` field.
- Mirror no banned word: a mirrored name never uses `kind` or `type` as a member name, and never uses a word § Rejected naming lists. A Compound File Binary (CFB) directory entry's object-type byte takes a named discriminant.

Unchanged and still binding, § Fixed derivation/construction forms: `is*` is a total `Guard<T>`, never throws, returns false off-shape; `parse*` is coercion producing `T | undefined`; `create*` is a factory constructing an entity or value; `*Of` is a builder combining constituent parts into a container, guard, or value. § Fixed lifecycle vocabulary: `clear` resets state without destroying the entity (`reset` is a banned synonym); `execute` runs a unit of work (`run` and `exec` are banned synonyms); `destroy` ends the entity (`shutdown` is a banned synonym). § Tallies: a lone unambiguous tally is `count`.
