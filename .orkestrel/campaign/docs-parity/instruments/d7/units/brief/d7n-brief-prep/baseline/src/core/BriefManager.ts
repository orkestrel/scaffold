/**
 * Implements the self-owning, versioned and content-hashed brief registry.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Record ids are MINTED from each brief's own content hash unless the caller names one,
 * so registering unchanged content twice is a version no-op and two callers who compiled
 * the same request land on the same id with no coordination. A call after `destroy()`
 * throws `BriefError('DESTROYED', …)`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { BriefManager, buildBrief, buildTask } from '@orkestrel/brief'
 *
 * const briefs = new BriefManager()
 * const record = briefs.add(buildBrief(buildTask('document', 'writing', 'Write the brief guide.')))
 * record.id === record.hash // true
 * briefs.destroy()
 * ```
