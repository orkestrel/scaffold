 *
 * It carries no classifier for a different reason than a reference does. A reference has none
 * because its container already fixes what it is; a citation has none because the closed
 * vocabulary this once held — `docs`, `spec`, `api`, `standard` — was a document taxonomy no
 * mechanism read, and its members were not disjoint, so a page documenting an API or a
 * specification that is also a standard forced an arbitrary choice.
 *
 * `url` is validated as a single line and NOT as a URL, so `url: 'docs'` is on-contract. That
 * is a limit rather than an oversight: constraining it needs a `pattern` on `citationShape`,
 * and the shape DSL's seeded generator builds a random alphanumeric string and throws when it
 * fails the pattern — so any pattern requiring a scheme's colon makes `createBriefContract()`
 * ungeneratable for the whole brief. Constraining only the guard would leave the guard and the
 * compiled shape disagreeing, which is the parity this package holds in lockstep. Keeping the

 * stricter member.
 *
 * The cost lands on one migration: `buildCitation` takes `(name, url, note)` where the 0.0.6

 * PRECEDENCE is `authority`, in ranked order, index 0 winning every conflict.
 *
 * `authority` therefore OVERLAPS the permission arrays by design: a ranked path ALWAYS also
 * sits in `read`, `edit`, or `locked`, because the executor has to open what it obeys, and
 * the `granted` gate rule refuses a brief where it does not. Read the permission arrays to

 * arrays with `authority` — that was already wrong before `authority` existed, because

 * reach mandatory authority without parsing `prompt`, which is written for a model.

 * strings onto the closed task vocabularies; an unmapped value drafts no task. The gate
 * is FIXED: readiness is this package's contract, not a caller setting.
 *
 * A borrowed engine is the caller's own code, not an attacker, and this package does not
 * treat it as one. The line is OWNERSHIP, and it produces obligations worth stating because
 * none of them is enforced in code:
 *
 * - Every value a borrowed engine returns is OWNED AT ARRIVAL — copied where a structured
 *   clone can carry it, captured into a frozen plain view where it cannot — and read once,
 *   where that copy or capture takes the reading. The captured view is what the `Briefing`
 *   replays, exactly as the clone arm always produced: a member the caller's prototype
 *   carries, outside the published contract, does not survive capture, and it never survived
 *   a structured clone either. What the engine does with its own object afterwards cannot
 *   reach a `Briefing`.
 * - Both returns are shape-checked with their packages' published guards — reasons' logical
 *   result guard for the verdict, interprets' interpretation guard at both of the interpret
 *   stage's doors. A malformed value at either door records `INTERPRET_FAILED` instead of
 *   escaping `compile` as a raw throw, and a supplied interpretation whose snapshot copy
 *   loses prototype-carried members is captured rather than refused.
 * - Neither engine is narrowed past its published contract. `Entity.value` is `unknown` and
 *   `LogicalResult` is an interface a class instance satisfies, so a value JSON cannot
 *   express is on-contract: its uncloneable leaves keep their identity inside the captured
 *   view rather than being refused.
 * - `actions` and `domains` are read as option slots ONCE, at construction, so replacing
 *   either property on the options object afterwards changes nothing. The map each slot
 *   names is dereferenced on every `compile`, and each lookup captures its mapping once
 *   through the own descriptor. Mutating a map between calls therefore changes what the next
 *   call derives, while a mapping that answers differently on a second read cannot change
 *   what one call already derived.
 *
 * Whether the engine is correct, and whether it answers the same way twice, remain the
 * caller's own problem.
