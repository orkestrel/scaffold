# Issues and fixes

Each item is one issue the `@orkestrel/agent` context campaign ran into, what was done about it, and the files to open. Read the open items first, then the area you are working in, then the file map at the end to find every issue a file carries.

Paths name their checkout:

- `agent:` is the `orkestrel/agent` repository, branch `claude/confident-maxwell-6nd0f3`;
- `scaffold:` is the `orkestrel/scaffold` repository, branch `claude/confident-maxwell-6nd0f3`;
- `desk:` is `mikesaintsg/desk`, and `ollama:` is `orkestrel/ollama`, on the same branch name;
- `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/` holds the benchmark harnesses, tools, probes, reports, and unit briefs, copied from the agent checkout's gitignored `tmp/` (`instruments/bench/` is `tmp/bench/`, `instruments/bench3/` is `tmp/bench3/`, `instruments/results/` is `tmp/bench/results/`).

The benchmark scenario fixes its own date: the Larkspur shift happens on Thursday 2026-10-08, whatever the calendar says. Judge a reply's date against that line, not the day a run happened.

Status counts: 55 open, 178 fixed, 74 worked around, 26 rejected. A rejected item is a design that measured worse and was dropped; `rejected.md` carries the measurement.

Add an item when an issue is found, and update its status and files when it is fixed.

## Thinking

### I-304 Records gave no reply on two goals under 2B thinking

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Under 2B thinking, records g01 and g10 got no reply: the first pass's last call wrote its answer as reasoning and ended the turn with no `</think>`, so content was empty, and the tool-free answer pass, run with thinking on, thought to the cap at 1,024 and 2,048 tokens. The harness log equals the wire and the raw output has no closing tag, so the model did this, not a parser.
- **Fix:** The answer pass always runs with thinking off: the package since commit 4852d4c, the harness first through `--answer-think off` and then as fixed behavior with the flag removed. `t2a-records` copies 1 to 4 replied on 40 of 40 goals with no call cut.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/ledgers/Ledger.ts`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/types.ts`, `commit 4852d4c (agent)`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/bench.mjs`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/probes/raw-probe.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/probes/raw.jsonl`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/THINKING.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/answer-think-fixed-brief.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/t6-answer-think-brief.md`.

### I-305 Raising the thinking cap did not fix the missing replies

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Raising the thinking cap from 1,024 to 2,048 tokens left g01 and g10 without a reply: the same answer-pass calls, with byte-identical prompts, spent the cap again.
- **Fix:** Dropped; the loop is in the thinking answer pass, which I-304 removes. The `--think-predict` flag stays for the window arithmetic.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md`.

### I-306 Thinking was dropped even inside a tool turn

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The stack sent no thinking back, even within a tool turn, unlike every surveyed vendor. Ollama 0.40 keeps input thinking after the last user message (29 of 29 replays grew by 41 to 529 prompt tokens) and drops it before (0 of 18 changed).
- **Fix:** Assistant messages record `thinking`; `ThinkingReplay` and `stripThinking` live in the root module; `ProviderInterface.replay` (default `'none'`) is applied by the agent loop, a relay server, and the ledger before every provider call and estimate; summaries and judge state never see thinking. Replay `'turn'` is unmeasured end to end, and I-157 blocks it on the Ollama wire.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/types.ts`, `agent:src/core/helpers.ts`, `agent:src/core/agents/Agent.ts`, `agent:src/core/providers/AgentProvider.ts`, `agent:src/core/providers/RelayStream.ts`, `agent:src/core/conversations/Conversation.ts`, `agent:guides/agent.md`, `commit d738cfe (agent)`, `commit ccdf574 (agent)`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/probes/replay-probe.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/probes/replay-cost.jsonl`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/THINKING.md`.

### I-307 Ledger budgets were blind to thinking

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The plan budget reserved no generation room, the gauge's room counted thinking the next request drops, and the reply reserve included thinking; the harness made up for it by hand, growing the window and cutting the share.
- **Fix:** `predict` reserves the generation cap in the plan, the recall room, and the close rule; `GaugeCall.thinking` and `GaugeOptions.replay` count only carried thinking; a ledger at W + P with `predict` P budgets like one at W without thinking.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/ledgers/Gauge.ts`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/Ledger.ts`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/helpers.ts`, `commit 85e3482 (agent)`.

### I-308 Review findings on the thinking change

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The review found calibration sending and pricing unstripped thinking, `computeThinking` throwing on cyclic call arguments and rejecting `respond`, unpinned calibrated-gauge options, docs claiming providers enforce replay, a self-derived test assertion, and the replay default repeated about 15 times.
- **Fix:** Commit f1f4c0a fixes each: calibration and summaries strip thinking, `computeThinking` falls back, tests pin the calibrated gauge, and each owner resolves its defaults once.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/t5-thinking-fix-brief.md`, `commit f1f4c0a (agent)`, `agent:tests/src/core/ledgers/Ledger.test.ts`.

### I-309 Checker findings on the thinking record unit

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The checker found a function declared inside a test callback and three doc rewrites a few characters longer than the text they replaced.
- **Fix:** The Orchestrator inlined the function; the length overrun was accepted.
- **Files:** `commit d738cfe (agent)`, `agent:tests/src/core/agents/helpers.test.ts`.

### I-310 Replay probe stopped on an overflowing compaction request

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The replay probe died on `t2-compaction-v1` request 60, the call that overflowed in its run (400 exceed_context_size), and never read that arm's earlier-turn rows.
- **Fix:** The 47 rows it kept cover every records and full-view request, and compaction is set aside, so the probe was not rerun.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/probes/replay-probe.ts`.

### I-312 The full view's answer run thought to the cap under thinking

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The main harness's tool-free answer run also ran with thinking on: in `t2w-control-v2`, g07 got no reply after its first call and its answer run both thought to the 2,048 cap with no content, so the records arm had the thinking-off fix and the full view did not. The per-call inspection found it.
- **Fix:** The main harness runs its answer run with thinking off under `--think` (sha `b5c49ee4`, 2026-10-09), and the four full-view thinking copies reran as `t2a-control`. They replied on 40 of 40 goals and cut 1 of 64 agent calls, a first pass whose answer run replied.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/bench.mjs`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/tools/inspect.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/control-answer-think-brief.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/plan-stage2.json`.

### I-331 The 4B with thinking on needs a sized cap

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The 2B's thinking cap was sized on 10 calls and the tail bound it, so the 4B with thinking on (`t4`) needs a cap sized on the calls its runs make, without letting a run go on for hours.
- **Fix:** None yet. `think-probe.ts` replays the 66 agent calls of `f4-records` v1 and v3 and `f4-control` v1 and v3 on the 4B with thinking on, `num_predict` 4,096, `num_ctx` 10,240, a 900-second timeout, and a stop after 3 cut calls. The cap is the smallest multiple of 256 at or over 1.5 times the largest self-stopped completion; no run starts when it exceeds 4,096.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/probes/think-probe.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/INVESTIGATE-4B.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/think-probe-4b-brief.md`.

## Briefing and records method

### I-282 Tool results as cached files

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A design treated tool results as cached files, which the user rejected.
- **Fix:** Four separate stores: messages, results by call id, judgments, and a pin ledger.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/BRIEFING.md`.

### I-283 Facts lacked lifetimes

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Facts go stale, change, or retire.
- **Fix:** Derived lifetimes in the design; the ledger carries category, amends, and supersedes.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/BRIEFING.md`.

### I-284 Per-topic records unbuilt

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Section 9 of BRIEFING.md was unbuilt.
- **Fix:** records.mjs behind --records on.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/records.mjs`.

### I-285 Ledger answers slow

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Ledger medians ran 58 to 76 s against 12 to 19 s.
- **Fix:** None yet. No change targets ledger answer time. The two ideas that could cut it, turning off the request-side judge and keeping two models loaded, are unmeasured, and the second needs the user's approval to change the daemon.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v8/ATTACK-BRIEFING.md:7`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/f4-records-v3/ledger.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/f4-control-v3/none.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/t2a-records-v1/ledger.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v8/ATTACK-BRIEFING.md`.

### I-286 Briefing lacked the date

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** 0 of 38 ledger calls stated the date against 20 of 20 control calls.
- **Fix:** --date on.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/README.md:477`.

### I-287 Tail replayed answers and older requests

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Replayed answers carried mistakes, and earlier unanswered requests got answered instead.
- **Fix:** --tail-answers drop and --tail-requests drop.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/README.md:548`.

### I-288 Idle briefing parts and the reply gate

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Pins 0 in 10 goals, read 0 calls, Values 0 of 38, tally cost 51 to 91 tokens; the gate held 4 answers, changed none, and cost 110.7 s.
- **Fix:** Rejected.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v8/ATTACK-BRIEFING.md:58`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md:34`.

### I-289 Delivery-date rule ignored

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** The 2B quotes Kenji's date in 27 of 27 probe replies and 9 of 9 rewrites. In v10 the 4B with thinking off fails g06 in 4 of 4 records copies, and the full view fails 11 of 12 runs.
- **Fix:** Measurement dropped the fixes on purpose: every rule placement passed 0 of 9, and a judge-triggered rewrite kept the date in 9 of 9. The method deep dive of 2026-10-09 found the rule and the 2026-10-12 date in the same answer request in 17 of 17 records runs, with nothing cut, so each loss is the model's, not the method's. The reopen condition is a larger model or thinking; the 4B with thinking on (`t4`) is the one untested case.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v9/FINDINGS-A1.md:44`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/METHOD-DEEP-DIVE.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/records-series-verdict.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/scenario.json`.

### I-290 Release owner named wrongly

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Marcus replaced Tomasz after rule m8 split.
- **Fix:** Records attribute the line (6 of 8).
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-291 Decoy switchboard number

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** 555-0142 dialed instead of 4127.
- **Fix:** F4 and records attribution (8 of 8).
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v8/ATTACK-BRIEFING.md:21`.

### I-292 $289 read as below $200

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** One copy omitted the approval code. The deep dive of 2026-10-09 found that in `t2a-records-v3` the thinking read $289 as over $200 and the reply skipped the code line, so the omission is not a misread amount.
- **Fix:** None in the method. The deep dive ruled out the `compareAmounts` line for g05. Records passes g05 in 13 of 17 runs against 1 of 8 for the 2B full view, and the 4B records passes 4 of 4; the 3 records failures are 2B omissions of a code that sat verbatim and current in the system message.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v9/FINDINGS-A1.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/METHOD-DEEP-DIVE.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/t2a-records-v3/ledger.md`.

### I-293 Approval-code rule omitted; claims conflict

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Request 5 omitted MX-4486 in several arms, and two reports disagree about the briefing.
- **Fix:** The deep dive of 2026-10-09 rules the records g05 losses as model variance: `a5-records-v2`, `a5-records-v7`, and `t2a-records-v3` omit MX-4486 that sat verbatim and current in the request, and `a5-records-v8` is a scorer false fail on MX-4471 named as replaced (I-327). The conflict between the two copies of the briefing design record is unresolved.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v8/TRACE-ledger.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/METHOD-DEEP-DIVE.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/audit/verdicts-b2.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md`.

### I-294 Replaced values revived

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** ESC-2291 and MX-4471 stayed beside corrections.
- **Fix:** Records hold the current value.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-295 Credit check lost

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** On the 2B, records passes g08 in 2 of 8 copies (`a5`) and 2 of 5 under thinking (`t2a`, `t2w`), while the full view passes 8 of 8. The 4B records passes 1 of 4 and the 4B full view 2 of 4, with the same omission. Every failure states the account and leaves out the fit verdict the request asks for.
- **Fix:** None yet. The deep dive of 2026-10-09 found no stage of the pipeline losing a fact in 17 of 17 records runs, and in `t2a-records-v1` the verdict and the content that drops it come from one thinking-on response. Ranked next steps: a cold replay of the 12 failing requests (U3) picks between cleaning account records of request sentences and fragments (I-329) and a verdict-first sentence in the application's system text; the relevance filter on pinned and record lines comes last.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v9/FINDINGS-A1.md:93`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/METHOD-DEEP-DIVE.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v9/probes/judge-relevance.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/records.mjs`.

### I-296 Recall handles cited

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A reply cited r8.
- **Fix:** The port's recall writes no handle. It returns the source sentences, with a lookup result prefixed by its tool name and arguments, and tests assert that no `m`/`r`/`p` handle reaches the model. The frozen bench3 harness still renders bare handles, and the live effect is unmeasured until the port's 8-copy series (U9) runs.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/ledgers/Ledger.ts`, `agent:tests/src/core/ledgers/Ledger.test.ts`, `agent:tests/src/core/ledgers/helpers.test.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md`, `commit 4852d4c (agent-port)`.

### I-297 Account scope strands a correction

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** m44 stayed in Luis's record.
- **Fix:** None yet. The port keeps account scope and records a desk-wide correction stated in one owner's message as a documented limit. Neither the global-correction-scope fix nor relevance filtering has been built or measured.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/records-candidate-audit-verdict.md`, `agent:guides/agent.md`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/helpers.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/records-port-planner.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md`.

### I-298 Person prefix trusts capitals

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Capitals can mislabel a person.
- **Fix:** None yet. The port keeps the capitals-based person prefix as a documented limit and has a test that pins the known false case. It narrows the prefix by skipping the run that opens a sentence, owner names, and system names. Antecedent grouping, which would remove the prefix, is unmeasured.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/ledgers/helpers.ts`, `agent:tests/src/core/ledgers/helpers.test.ts`, `agent:guides/agent.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md`.

### I-299 Records misroute Grace's escalation

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** 5 of 8 copies name a wrong recipient.
- **Fix:** None yet for the 2B with thinking off. No mechanism has been traced and no fix built. Under the 4B and under 2B thinking, every audited records Grace escalation in v10 named the right recipients, but that is a different condition, not a fix.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/records-series-verdict.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/audit/verdicts-b1.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/audit/verdicts-b2.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/audit/verdicts-b3.json`.

### I-300 Records candidate audit failures

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Claims 2, 5, 6, and 8 failed.
- **Fix:** The ledger port fixes claims 2 (both halves), 5a, and 8 in package code, and tests cover each one. It fixes claim 6 by construction only: no Ledger test drives a budget cut to a 'result not shown' stub. Claim 5b stays a documented limit tracked as I-298, and the records harness is unchanged on purpose. To close this, add a Ledger test in which a tight budget cuts a lookup's record lines and the tail stub reads 'result not shown'.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/records-candidate-claims.md`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/Ledger.ts`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/helpers.ts`, `agent:tests/src/core/ledgers/Ledger.test.ts`, `agent:tests/src/core/ledgers/helpers.test.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/records-port-planner.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/records-candidate-audit-verdict.md`, `commit 4852d4c (agent, branch port)`.

### I-301 Records wiring review findings

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Four review findings.
- **Fix:** Applied; proof exits 0.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-302 Records module major finding

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Unnamed major finding.
- **Fix:** Fixed; 251 of 251 checks.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/records-check.mjs`.

### I-303 Refined briefing ties full view

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** +0.5 per copy, lower bound -0.35.
- **Fix:** Dropped as an arm.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-323 Three readers of the leftover window, not one

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The final-check record said only the recall room reads the leftover window. The records harness also reads it to close the arm tools and to price an unpinned reply at the deny gate, and its reply reserve counts thinking tokens, so under thinking the tools can close sooner (attack round, records-harness C2).
- **Fix:** `FINAL-CHECK.md` names all three readers. No records request in the v10 thinking or 4B runs carries the closure or narrowing text, so no closure fired. The port counts only carried thinking in the reserve (I-307).
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/bench.mjs:1341`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/bench.mjs:1351`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md`.

### I-328 The delivery-date rule is filed off the delivery topic

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Seed 6, the rule that forbids a written delivery date, reads delivery at 0.444 against the 0.60 topic threshold, so it ranks off-topic for g06 and would be the first Rules line a consolidation cut drops. It cost nothing in v9 or v10: no g06 request cut a line.
- **Fix:** None; deferred while no Rules line is cut. Judge topics per sentence for a split record line, or refit the delivery criterion.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v3/cal-categories.jsonl:105`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/records.mjs:124`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/METHOD-DEEP-DIVE.md`.

### I-329 Account records carry request sentences and fragments

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The Halvorsen record lists 'Anyway, can you check where the Halvorsen shipment actually is?' and 'I transposed the digits.' as facts, and the late $1,240 order total twice beside the $1,240 outstanding. On the 2B, this noise sits in every failing g08 briefing.
- **Fix:** None yet. Ranked fourth in the deep dive: drop user-request sentences and lines with no id, number, or name from account records, conditional on the cold replay (U3) showing the noise causes the omission.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/records.mjs`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/helpers.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/METHOD-DEEP-DIVE.md`.

## Judge and selection

### I-203 System One implementations disagree on readings and shapes

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Confidence differs (Jev's formula, Mica's max(p), Ollama's entropy: 0.8718 against 0.9536 for one tev1 choice), score differs, Mica's server uses all-400 errors and an 8,192 limit, and legend and probabilities are maps in Jev and arrays in llama.cpp.
- **Fix:** The client sends the TypeSafe body unchanged, reads probabilities, derives measures in computeReading, and accepts a map or an array.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/validators.ts`, `commit 3dd7586 (agent)`, `commit 46a0b3d (agent)`.

### I-204 Each judge question costs about 4 s on the CPU host

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Each question costs about 4 s on this host.
- **Fix:** Recorded judgments are reused and a work limit is built in.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-205 Graded and necessity question forms

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Mica's three-level grade was weak, score came out as expected on 2 of 4 rows, and the 'cannot be carried out without' wording missed a standing rule at 0.896.
- **Fix:** Binary questions only, with the 'must respect' needed wording (10 of 10, confidence 0.6 to 0.99).
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md`.

### I-206 Pair-only state hides an earlier rule's answer

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** The pair-only state misread a standing rule at 0.804.
- **Fix:** The needed question reads the whole view; relation questions read the pair at half the tokens.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md:53`.

### I-207 Selection handler home

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The plan first ruled the handler scope-only, which switches selection off for tool-only switches such as apply(undefined) and forces a named scope; agent-only cannot switch mode and policy together.
- **Fix:** Two homes: AgentOptions.select is the default and the active scope's select overrides it.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`, `commit 191fe41 (scaffold)`.

### I-208 tev1 refuses prompts over 2,050 tokens

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** tev1's Modelfile num_ctx caps input at 2,050 tokens, and the rendered state is about 4,100, so every question failed and selection fell back to the full view.
- **Fix:** Mica is the judge.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/JUDGE.md`.

### I-209 tev1 cannot separate needed from noise

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** tev1 read six known pairs at 0.45 to 0.49, needed 0.36 to 0.61 against noise 0.18 to 0.67 over ten goals, it is undocumented beyond hosted Jev 1.13, and the wire has no calibration field.
- **Fix:** Rejected for selection; a structured-state probe has not run.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/JUDGE.md:15`.

### I-210 Mica misses indirect needs

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** At 0.90 with the stock criterion Mica kept 18 of 21 facts, missing an approval-code correction, a no-written-date rule, and an account number a lookup resolves.
- **Fix:** The lookup criterion lifts it to 19 of 21, keeping 23% of the view and dropping 93% of noise.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/JUDGE.md`.

### I-211 Threshold alternatives 0.70, 0.80, and 0.95

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** 0.70 and 0.80 kept 16 of 21 must-keep messages; 0.95 kept 299 messages against 165, scored 4 of 10 strict, and carried stale replies.
- **Fix:** Rejected; the threshold is the application's.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/JUDGE.md:71`.

### I-212 Threshold 0.9 calibrated on a toy view

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** 0.9 was fitted on a 7-line view in another rendering and kept 7 of 8 irrelevant subjects.
- **Fix:** Calibration reran on the real 48-message view against ground truth.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v2/cal-mica-bounded/calibration.md`.

### I-213 Thresholds fitted in-sample

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** 0.90, the 0.96 fit (margin 0.0015), and the records fits (m29 0.717 against 0.7) come from the same 48-message seed. The records arm's `LEDGER_FIT` and refined profile were fitted on the seed every reworded copy shares, so every v9 and v10 records reading is in-sample; the full view has no fitted parameter (attack round, records-harness C).
- **Fix:** None yet. A held-out goal set is required, and none has been labeled. `FINAL-CHECK.md` § In-sample fit states the limit beside every v10 band.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/JUDGE.md:71`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v9/RECORDS-PLAN.md:50`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/bench.mjs:829`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md:21`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:450`.

### I-214 Judge filings imported from a recording

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The filings of the 48 morning messages came from an earlier recording, so accuracy was in-sample and cost uncounted.
- **Fix:** A live recheck of 42 questions matched within 0.015; a live filing costs about 15 min.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-215 Stock JSON state costs and buries signal

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Stock JSON costs 2,433 prompt tokens per question against 1,679 plain, and whole-view tokens grow quadratically (3,800 to 5,300 per question).
- **Fix:** A bounded state (2 neighbors) runs about 360 tokens and 4 s; bench.mjs exposes --state stock, plain, or bounded.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/bench.mjs`.

### I-216 Selection alone does not bound the prompt

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** At 0.9 Mica kept nearly every message; selection overflowed from g05 (3 of 10), cost 463,500 judge prompt tokens over 65 min, and limit screened oldest first.
- **Fix:** Rejected; a bounded state with recent-first candidates is deferred.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/REPORT.md:46`.

### I-217 Per-message selection too costly

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Per-message selection took 48 to 78 judge questions and about 7 min per answer, knew 45 of 60, and gave 3 to 5 strict passes against 5 for compaction at 0.6 min.
- **Fix:** Cut from the routine set; its scores stay as the accuracy reference.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/JUDGE.md:71`.

### I-218 Selection stacked on compaction

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Selection plus capped compaction gave 5 of 10, equal to compaction, for 322,100 judge prompt tokens; Round A graded it 35 of 60, the lowest.
- **Fix:** Dropped on 2026-10-09.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v7/GRADES-both.md`.

### I-219 One judge error discarded the whole selection

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A single judge HTTP error sent the goal to the full view.
- **Fix:** createSelection leaves a failed subject undecided and faults only when every call failed.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/contexts/helpers.ts`, `commit 2418a2b (agent)`.

### I-220 Selection split a request from its reply

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A g03 request (p 0.0814) was dropped while its send_reply call and result stayed, and g04 resent the note word for word.
- **Fix:** filterSelectionMessages keeps each request with every message up to the next request as one exchange.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/conversations/helpers.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/AUDIT.md:15`, `commit 2418a2b (agent)`.

### I-221 Late tool result orphaned under duplicate call ids

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A late tool result fell into an orphan run, and a positional leader with duplicate call ids claimed it first.
- **Fix:** The unique call owner is read first; position decides only when no assistant owns the call.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/contexts/helpers.ts`, `commit 9253b5d (agent)`, `commit c8ca0f5 (agent)`.

### I-222 Invalid threshold or limit not coded

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** An invalid threshold or limit threw an uncoded RangeError.
- **Fix:** Throws SelectionError with code THRESHOLD or LIMIT.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/contexts/errors.ts`, `commit 9253b5d (agent)`.

### I-223 Request screened as a subject

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Selection asked about the request, which can never be dropped, spending questions and limit.
- **Fix:** Screened subjects exclude the request.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/contexts/factories.ts`, `commit 9253b5d (agent)`.

### I-224 Judgment matching lost key order

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** matchesJudgment compared the question member by member.
- **Fix:** Matches on the JSON text with key order kept.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/conversations/JudgmentManager.ts`, `commit f28d222 (agent)`.

### I-225 Judge state serialized image payloads

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The rendered judge state carried base64 images, which can exceed a small server's limit and fault every selection.
- **Fix:** The rendered state omits images, pinned by a mutant-failing case.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/contexts/helpers.ts`, `commit f28d222 (agent)`.

### I-226 Judge identity used the server's model name

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A server reporting an alias could not reuse its records, and a snapshot wrote an empty judgments member.
- **Fix:** The judgment carries the configured identity and the snapshot omits empty judgments.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/conversations/JudgmentManager.ts`, `commit c6e3437 (agent)`.

### I-227 Exchange-whole selection grows kept sets

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Kept sets grew from 19 to 36 messages, the 15% fee applied twice, withdrawn rules and decoys stayed, and runs scored 2 of 4 and 5/10/12 strict.
- **Fix:** None yet. The exchange-unit arm has no live result, and the package's stock selection still keeps whole exchanges.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v5/cal-exchange/calibration.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:432`, `agent:src/core/contexts/helpers.ts:123`.

### I-228 No correction chaining

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Raw selection cannot tell that a later message cancels an earlier one, so the withdrawn fee rule stayed without its withdrawal; under compaction chaining asked 32 questions and chained nothing.
- **Fix:** None yet for raw selection. --chain corrections still has no verdict. The ported records classifier (amends and supersedes pairs, stale marking) might cover withdrawals, but no measurement shows that it does for this case.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/README.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:540`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/README.md:223`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/Classifier.ts:72`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v9/RECORDS-PLAN.md:159`.

### I-229 Judge drift after a runner load

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Mica is identical within a process (48 of 48) but drifts up to 0.10 in its first 15 questions after a load and up to 0.04 per call.
- **Fix:** Each decision records its margin to the cut and the runner stays warm across a goal.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v4/drift/judge-drift.md`.

### I-230 Presence rule gated on desk filing

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Rule m6 read delivery at 0.444 against a 0.6 fit, so it would drop from the g06 view on every copy.
- **Fix:** Rejected.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md`.

### I-231 Date line dropped by selection

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The seed 0 date line scored p 0.005 to 0.040 and was dropped, while 'off tomorrow, Friday' stayed and read as a deadline.
- **Fix:** The screen excludes seed 0 and the date lives in system text.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/AUDIT.md:26`.

### I-232 JSON-tuple question ids untested on live servers

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Whether a live System One or TypeSafe server accepts an id such as ["needed",ID_A,ID_B] is not evidenced on this host.
- **Fix:** None yet. The planned probe is the desk's first live POST /turn in desk-select, and it has not run.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:178`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:968`.

### I-233 Protocol-conformance lanes disagreed

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The lanes disagreed on null, refusal shape, batch split, errors, and model per request.
- **Fix:** Ruled: null only where the format distinguishes it, refusals beside answers, one batch boolean, provider errors mirrored.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md`.

### I-234 Selection fixture substitutes recorded probabilities

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The review was to rule whether substituting recorded probabilities per question id is a protocol fixture or a scripted outcome; no verdict is recorded.
- **Fix:** None. Nobody has ruled whether the fixture is a protocol fixture or a scripted outcome, and the fixture is unchanged.
- **Files:** `agent:tests/setup.ts:208`, `agent:tests/src/core/contexts/factories.test.ts:471`.

### I-235 Judge misreads message 11 as a request

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Message 11 reads as request at 0.73, so auto-pin never pins the gift note.
- **Fix:** Message 11 is reached through topic and names.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/README.md:336`.

### I-236 Score-confidence mismatch was an arithmetic error

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Research flagged a score-confidence mismatch against the System One formula. The arithmetic was wrong: even_spread for n=3 is 2/3, not 4/3.
- **Fix:** Corrected in the evidence; the published 0.35 example matches 2/3.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md`, `agent:tmp/units/judge-protocol.md` (not in a checkout).

## Compaction

### I-237 Uncapped compaction does not bound the prompt

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Each fold adds a recap and folds never merge: uncapped compaction gave 3 of 10, grew to 13 sections, and overflowed from g07; with sections 3 it gave 5 of 10 at 962 to 2,114 tokens.
- **Fix:** Rejected uncapped; the brief sets sections with window.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/REPORT.md:44`.

### I-238 Sections default undecided

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Whether the manager defaults a sections cap is open for the user.
- **Fix:** None yet. The user has not ruled, and the manager still leaves sections unlimited. The user set compaction aside on 2026-10-09, which removes it from the series but does not decide the default.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:197`, `agent:src/core/conversations/types.ts:215`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:771`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md:40`.

### I-239 Summaries invented identifiers

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** A two-message fold invented order and tracking numbers that reached a reply.
- **Fix:** The guard rejects ids no folded message states, retries once naming the allowed set, then drops the sentences.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/README.md:247`.

### I-240 Identifier guard misfired on tool arguments and the date

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The guard rejected the scenario date and LH-79215, which appear only in tool-call arguments.
- **Fix:** The allowed set holds the input's ids and the summarizer system message's ids, and --probe-guard covers an id held only in arguments.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/README.md:121`.

### I-241 Merges erase sections and lose identifiers

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Merges returned the first section verbatim (all 9 in one run) and lost MX-4486, Tomasz, ext 4127, and the gift note; merged sections corrupted kept facts.
- **Fix:** None yet. The merge still summarizes section summaries rather than the folded originals, and nothing checks for lost identifiers.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v6/diag/COMPACTION.md:9`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/AUDIT.md:29`, `agent:src/core/conversations/Conversation.ts:276`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/AUDIT.md:28`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:735`.

### I-242 Folds split calls and exchanges

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Count-based cuts ignored roles: a g01 request was folded with its calls left live, and a call folded with its result live.
- **Fix:** compact() moves its cut out of call groups to the user message that opens the exchange and returns undefined when nothing folds.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/conversations/Conversation.ts`, `commit 2418a2b (agent)`.

### I-243 Rollup built for output the model never sees

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** 4 of 9 summarizer calls built a rollup no agent request carried.
- **Fix:** Rollup is opt-in, default false; the release note names the change.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/conversations/ConversationManager.ts`, `commit f699ddc (agent)`.

### I-244 Post-dispatch fold ran after the abort

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Agent.#trim ran after tool dispatch with no abort check, about 57 s of a 64.2 s goal.
- **Fix:** #trim folds nothing after the run's abort.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/agents/Agent.ts`, `commit 2418a2b (agent)`.

### I-245 Summaries lost dates and invented a Friday deadline

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The summarizer never saw the date, so 'off tomorrow, Friday' became a deadline.
- **Fix:** None yet. The dated system message and the absolute-date instruction still left 'tomorrow' on request 7. The rewritten instruction is untested, and compaction is set aside as of 2026-10-09.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/AUDIT.md:20`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:753`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md:46`.

### I-246 No facts. escape erased facts

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The summarizer wrote 'No facts.' on id-bearing folds (seed 25 to 43 lost ESC-2219, MX-4486, FL-660412), giving 3 of 10 against 6.
- **Fix:** No facts. over an id-bearing fold is a failure, the retry keeping fewer losses wins, and lost ids return with their sentence.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v6/diag/COMPACTION.md:3`.

### I-247 Id-free folds lose rules and the withdrawn fee

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** The fee-withdrawal fold still came back No facts., so the 15% fee stayed live and request 1 refunded $245.65 on it.
- **Fix:** A fix was planned, but compaction was dropped and it sits unused.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-248 Guard restored ids from assistant replies

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The guard recirculated model-written text such as 'MX-4471 is required' and the decoy 555-0142.
- **Fix:** Restores only from user messages and lookup results.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/README.md:410`.

### I-249 Compaction measured worse and dropped

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Round A graded compaction 40 of 60 against the full view's 41 and the ledger's 49; summaries lost ids and invented details, and guard retries made answers slow (117 s median).
- **Fix:** Dropped on 2026-10-09; kept only as a common baseline.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v7/GRADES-compaction.md`.

### I-250 Compaction under thinking too slow

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Under 2B thinking one copy ran 79.5 min (median 312.5 s per answer); 4B summaries took about 300 s per fold.
- **Fix:** Set aside on 2026-10-09; the series runs without compaction.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/plan-thinking.json`.

### I-251 Compaction letters to the wrong customer

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** At the 1,024 cap the thinking compaction arm addressed letters to Kenji from g06 on, passing 4 against 6 for records.
- **Fix:** Removed from the plan with compaction.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-252 Context-window arms never fired compaction

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The first full run at ctx 6144 and window 3000 never fired compaction, so it did not stress the window. The combined arm never fired compaction either.
- **Fix:** The comparison reran at ctx 3072 and window 1200. The v4 both arm runs at window 1,000; no other fix for the combined arm is recorded.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/full-ctx6144/`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/full/runner.sh`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v4/`.

### I-253 Generic and next-step summary instructions

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Generic summary instructions scored 3 of 10 with 11 of 20 correct, against 5 and 14 for the tuned summary. Next-step text polluted the recap.
- **Fix:** Rejected; the tuned summary instructions stay.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md:46`.

## Bench harness

### I-254 Tool results reach the model without a name

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Tool messages had no name and call ids are dropped, so results paired by position.
- **Fix:** tool_name is sent, but the renderer ignores it; exchanges and call groups kept whole carry the pairing.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/AUDIT.md:17`.

### I-255 System prompt pushed searches

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The prompt told the model to search when a fact 'is not in view', though the view showed no sign of a gap.
- **Fix:** Rewritten; the system text states messages can be omitted.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-256 Model skipped send_reply

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The model wrote replies as prose and skipped send_reply in 37 of 172 goals; the tool design leaked its label, and a 20-token wording change moved skips from 4 to 0.
- **Fix:** The final message with no tool call is the reply, with a tools-free answer run.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/README.md:152`.

### I-257 Extra answer turn skipped selection

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The no-tools answer turn bypassed selection.
- **Fix:** It routes through selection.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-258 Final message may be narration

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** A run can end on narration such as 'let me check that'; no count is recorded.
- **Fix:** None yet. No count is recorded, and no harness or package code detects a final message that is only narration.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md:42`, `commit 4852d4c (agent)`.

### I-259 Overflow accounting missed refused calls

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Request 10 was refused as too long, and the accounting did not count it.
- **Fix:** Counts the refused call.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-260 Full view overflows the small window

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** At 3,072 tokens the full view overflowed from g04 or g05 (3 of 10).
- **Fix:** Dropped from the routine set.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md`.

### I-261 Repeat-call loops

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The model repeated the same call to the turn limit (7 repeats; request 7 used 9 turns) and ignored a notice.
- **Fix:** The first repeat ends the turn and one no-tools turn answers; request 7 then used 3 turns.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/bench.mjs`.

### I-262 Answer turn produced no text

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** After a repeat stop the answer turn produced a tool call with no text (a1-ledger g03, g04), and three A1 goals ended without a reply.
- **Fix:** --repeat-stop all, --answer-view collapsed, --answer-cue on, --recall-budget 2, --recall-split on, --recall-category off; the frozen series replied on 70 of 70 goals.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/README.md:598`.

### I-263 Replay ENOENT on the judgments path

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Replay failed on the default judgments path.
- **Fix:** locateJudgments.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-264 Variant copies crashed bench3

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Scenario members differed in the variant files.
- **Fix:** variants/ledger copies.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/variants/ledger/v1.json`.

### I-265 Model copied the example id from tool descriptions

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** 'such as LH-12345' drew 6 lookups and replaced Kenji's order in request 6.
- **Fix:** The description reads 'LH, a hyphen, then digits' with no example.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-266 History search missed multi-word queries

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Search required every word and returned the 6 most recent hits, so it missed the ticket correction and surfaced the switchboard number.
- **Fix:** Ranked by matched words, deduplicated, size-bounded.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-267 search_history rarely called

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** No graded request called it in the first runs, and under the cap it ran in 4 goals of 80 with phrases the search missed.
- **Fix:** Recall replaces it in the ledger arm; word-wise search is deferred.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/AUDIT.md:22`.

### I-268 Sampler settings applied implicitly

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The model's shipped settings, including a repetition penalty, were applied silently.
- **Fix:** Sent on every call; the smoke run matched exactly.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-269 Model echoed handle prefixes and amended marks

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** [mN] prefixes and [amended by] marks in content reached answers (g01 answered [m48]).
- **Fix:** The tail sends stored content bare; the [rN] recall wrapper remains.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/AUDIT.md:21`.

### I-270 Recall loops

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Recall answered a handle with nothing and a repeat with 'shown in rN', up to 8 calls; 8 of 9 no-answer runs were recall chains.
- **Fix:** Handle answers fixed, a recall budget and cue added, stop-on-repeat ends loops.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-271 Budgets ignored the tool-schema cost

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The token scale was fitted on prompts with a fixed 691-token schema and the budget left out about 835 tokens of tools, so 6 of 20 requests overflowed and the estimate ran 30% under qwen.
- **Fix:** Schema cost charged and priced apart; first prompt fell from about 2,500 to 1,872 tokens.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/README.md:702`.

### I-272 First briefing run defects

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The first ledger run's budget flag fired on every goal, the tail's share was charged unused, and goal facts stopped pinning from goal 3. Recall by handle returned nothing, shown-in-rN lines repeated, and five deterministic judge errors were re-asked at every select site.
- **Fix:** The ledger-debug unit fixed them against a replay fixture that passes 87 checks; the source does not map each defect to its change.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/bench.mjs`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/constants.ts`.

### I-273 Lifetime arms and long scenario

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The 10-request scenario barely tests replaced facts, and the 152-message scenario lacks a verified bench3 loader.
- **Fix:** None yet. The long scenario has no ledger section, and bench3 refuses a scenario without one, so no loader runs it.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/scenario-long.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/check-long.mjs`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/bench.mjs:272`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:847`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md:36`.

### I-274 Frozen harness defects

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** A repeated call id hides the repeat stop, the answer run keeps seed calls, a first-run timeout skips it, joined handles stay joined, a category prices recall, and the empty-reply guard is untested; edge paths have no live footprint.
- **Fix:** The ledger port on branch port (HEAD 4852d4c) fixes F3, F4a, F5, F6 (by removing recall by handle), and F8 in package code, and a test covers each one. The frozen harness still has every defect, and the successor harness unit that this issue names has not been applied. O1 is out of the port's scope, so the harness's empty-reply guard is still untested.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/frozen-harness-audit-verdict.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/frozen-harness-claims.md`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/Ledger.ts`, `agent:tests/src/core/ledgers/Ledger.test.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/records-port-planner.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/bench.mjs`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md`, `commit 4852d4c (agent, branch port)`.

### I-275 Report regex blind to records

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The report counted blocks by '## ' headings, so '###' headings went unseen.
- **Fix:** A shared one-line patch; tails compare byte-sensitively.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v9/recordsrender/README.md`.

### I-276 Series launches stop at their time budget

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** A launch stops when its time budget runs out.
- **Fix:** Relaunch, with probes between launches.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v7/tools/series.ts`.

### I-277 Fault string carries a random message id

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Byte comparisons differ on fault strings.
- **Fix:** Ruled inherited nondeterminism; request bodies match.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/records-candidate-audit-verdict.md`.

### I-278 Temperature-0 output varied with prompt-cache history

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Identical request bytes gave 78 tokens cold and 187 after an overlapping prior request, so the control diverged from its earlier run. The cause was prompt-cache history, not the bytes.
- **Fix:** Every run cold-starts through cold-start.mjs, which unloads models and waits for an empty /api/ps, and records its wire through record-fetch.mjs. Cold reruns reproduced byte for byte in the A0 check.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v8/DIVERGENCE.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v7/tools/run-one.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v7/tools/cold-start.mjs`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v7/tools/record-fetch.mjs`.

### I-279 Scorer selection bias and a one-sided audit

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Permissive scoring passed replies with a stale value or a denied fit, and fixes that flipped only briefing rows biased the comparison. Auditing failures alone inflated the full view with false passes such as $3,860 available credit.
- **Fix:** The strict scorer is restored, and two Haiku checkers with a tiebreak judge every pass and failure blind while Astra checks each batch. adjudicated.ts tallies misreads as passes and ambiguous rows as a range; batch 1 of 110 rows gave 9 false passes, 8 ambiguous passes, and 2 misreads.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/rescore.mjs`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/tools/adjudicated.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/audit/verdicts-b1.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md:68-69`, `commit 6c939a9 (scaffold)`.

### I-280 Scorer misread markdown, verdict words, a stale id, and a deadline

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The scorer misread markdown table cells, verdict words, the stale code MX-4471, and the Friday deadline.
- **Fix:** Each has a negative case, and forbidden patterns use lookbehind and lookahead lists such as not and no longer. scorer-check.ts passes 26 of 26.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/rescore.mjs`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v9/tools/scorer-check.ts`.

### I-281 Single runs and 8-port screens as evidence

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Cold reruns of one design varied by up to 2 passes, and an 8-port screen passed a configuration the 16-port reading failed.
- **Fix:** Rejected as evidence; decisions use the paired 8-copy band and the 16-port set.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md:70`.

### I-317 The call inspection misread calibration and summarizer calls

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The per-call inspection judged calibration and summarizer calls by the agent's think and cap rules and compared a loose call count with the harness log (attack round, machinery F5).
- **Fix:** `inspect.ts` classes a call with `num_predict` 1 as calibration and a tool-free call with the summarizer's system text as a summary, whatever the condition, leaves both out of the think, cap, and empty checks, and requires the agent-call count to equal the harness log exactly. Over the 16 stage 1 runs on 2026-10-09: 292 calls, 1 cut, 6 empty first passes, every count equal.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/tools/inspect.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/audit/inspect.json`.

### I-318 The series could start over a running or finished run

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** `series.ts` started with a run still open in `run.log`, and `run-one.ts` wrote into an output directory, log, or wire directory that already existed (attack round, machinery F4).
- **Fix:** Staged as `series.ts.next` and `run-one.ts.next` beside the originals: the series refuses (exit 2) a start line with no end line, and a run refuses (exit 2) an existing output. They install between runs after stage 2.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v7/tools/series.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v7/tools/run-one.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/harness-tooling-fix-brief.md`.

### I-319 A run did not record the harness it ran on

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** `run.log` named each run's arguments but not the harness file's hash, so a report had to infer which harness a run used from install times (attack round, machinery F8).
- **Fix:** Staged in `run-one.ts.next`: the start line ends with ` harness-sha256 HEX`. Until it installs, `FINAL-CHECK.md` names each condition's harness sha by hand.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v7/tools/run-one.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/run-log.txt`.

### I-320 The records self-check skipped the run path's think setting

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** `--check-ledger` built its arm outside the path `runLedger` uses, so it could pass while a live run sent the wrong `think` on the answer pass (attack round, records-harness C6).
- **Fix:** Staged in `bench3/bench.mjs.next`: `runLedger` passes `think: flags.think` explicitly, and the answer-pass check builds its arm through that path with thinking on and asserts `think: false` on the answer pass and `think: true` on the first pass. It installs after stage 2.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/bench.mjs`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/harness-tooling-fix-brief.md`.

### I-321 The harness READMEs misstated the thinking flags

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The records README said the answer pass thinks, and neither README listed `--think-predict` or said that `num_predict` comes from it (attack round, records-harness B, main-harness F4).
- **Fix:** Both READMEs state that the tool-free answer pass sends `think: false` and keeps the `num_predict` cap, that `num_predict` is the `--think-predict` value (default 1,024), and list the flag.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/README.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/README.md`.

## Scoring and audit

### I-311 A scenario date read against the calendar

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The work ran on real dates 2026-10-08 and 2026-10-09 while the scenario fixes its today at Thursday 2026-10-08, so a reply's 'today (Friday, 2026-10-09)' reads right by the calendar and wrong by the scenario, and a report can state a date without saying which it means.
- **Fix:** Judge every date in a reply against the scenario's date line, which both harnesses read from fixed data (`scenario.json` system text and `scenario.ledger.clock`), and name which date a record or report means.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/scenario.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/bench.mjs:993-1010`.

### I-315 The failure audit brief was asymmetric

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The failure items carried a `toolsOk` field and the failure brief named a tool failure as a point, which the pass brief did not; and a misread stood on the flagged points alone, while a pass had to be right on every point (attack round, machinery F2 and F3).
- **Fix:** `items.ts` drops `toolsOk`. The failure brief in `audit.js` rules a misread only when every flagged point is a misread and the whole reply meets the pass standard, and rules real whenever the reply would be a false pass. All 70 audited failures were re-audited: 64 real, 4 ambiguous, 2 misread, 0 unresolved. The first readings sit in `audit/superseded/`.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/tools/items.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/tools/audit.js`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/audit/verdicts-r1.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/audit-fix-brief.md`.

### I-316 Audit ids were guessable and dropped verdicts went unnoticed

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Item ids could be traced to their run, the key files sat in the directory the auditors read, an item no auditor returned vanished from the tally, and the tally accepted a missing key or a duplicate id (attack round, machinery F6 and F7).
- **Fix:** Ids are salted and the keys sit in `audit-keys/`. `audit.js` takes each chunk's ids and rules any id no auditor returns unresolved. `tally.ts` exits 1 on a verdict with no key, an id in two verdict files, or a paired run without 10 audited rows.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/tools/items.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/tools/audit.js`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/tools/tally.ts`.

### I-322 Rescore read every row against the default scenario

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** `rescore.mjs` scored each row with `scenario.json`'s scoring fields even when the row named a variant file, so a variant whose fields differ would be misscored (attack round, main-harness F5).
- **Fix:** Staged as `rescore.mjs.next`: it exits 2 naming the goal and field when a row's scenario file has scoring fields that differ from `scenario.json`'s.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/rescore.mjs`.

### I-327 Scorer rules misfire on four goals

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The scorer fails a reply that names MX-4471 as the replaced code on g03 and g05; fails any written date on g06, the 2026-10-07 ship date included, though the rule forbids only a promised delivery date; passes any available-credit figure on g08, $3,860 and $4,240 included; and misses the scrapped restocking fee on g01 (method deep dive; attack round, main-harness F3).
- **Fix:** None yet. Scorer unit U2: a lookbehind for 'original' and 'rotated from' on MX-4471, a g06 pattern that allows a ship date, a g08 check that fails any figure but $3,760, and the g05 restocking patterns in g01's `forbiddenPatterns` across the 18 scenario files, then a rescore of every v9 and v10 row that lists each changed verdict.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/scenario.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/variants`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/rescore.mjs`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/METHOD-DEEP-DIVE.md`.

### I-330 A made-up gift-note action goes unscored

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** `f4-records` v1, v3, v4 and `f4-control-v4` claim to have added a gift note, while the lookup says gift note text is not recorded on the order. No goal scores it.
- **Fix:** None yet. Add a g06 forbidden pattern for a claimed gift-note action in scorer unit U2, or rule it out of scope.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/scenario.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/METHOD-DEEP-DIVE.md`.

## Measurement method

### I-313 The 4B think-off band sits on its bound at four copies

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Under the corrected audit, 4B records read 7.50–8.00 passes per copy against 5.50–7.25 for the full view over copies 1 to 4; the band clears at the high end (bound 0.25) and sits at 0.00 at the low end. The 4B lifts the full view more than records: records reaches 30 of 40 cells at the low end, the full view's who-is-who errors on g03 and g07 mostly go away, and g05, g06, and g08 fail in both arms.
- **Fix:** None yet. Copies 5 to 8 of records and the full view run in stage 2, as the final-check plan prescribes for a pair that does not clear at the low end.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/tools/tally.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/audit/tally.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/INVESTIGATE-4B.md`.

### I-314 The thinking band paired records with an unequal full view

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The first thinking table paired `t2a-records`, whose answer pass ran with thinking off, with `t2w-control`, whose answer run still thought, so the full view kept a defect records no longer had (attack round of 2026-10-09: records-harness A, main-harness F1, machinery F1).
- **Fix:** `t2a-control` v1 to v4 reran on the fixed main harness and were audited blind. The pair `t2a-records` against `t2a-control` clears at every end: low 1.29, high 0.49, across 0.21. `FINAL-CHECK.md` was restated from that pair.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/audit/tally.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/audit/verdicts-c1.json`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/audit/attack.json`.

### I-324 The full view's generation room shrinks as the shift grows

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The full view's prompt grows across the shift while `num_ctx` stays fixed, so late calls have less room than the thinking cap; a `t2w-control-v2` g10 call left 1,463 tokens against the 2,048 cap (attack round, main-harness F2).
- **Fix:** `FINAL-CHECK.md` states it. The largest `t2a-control` prompts left 2,496 to 4,037 tokens, and no full-view call came within 64 tokens of `num_ctx`, so no result changed.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/bench.mjs:544`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md`.

## Agent package code

### I-094 Agent source is mostly comment prose that narrates history

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** src/core measured 7,781 lines: 2,915 code and 4,537 comment (58%); types.ts is 76% comment, and comments narrated history. The first hygiene pass read its goal too narrowly: 20 of 30 sampled comments still narrated.
- **Fix:** Two hygiene passes took the banned phrases and history markers to 0 with 0 non-comment lines changed. The remaining comment load rides with the units that rewrite each file.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/types.ts`, `commit 47fc4d4 (agent)`, `commit 3b1b7c2 (agent)`.

### I-095 Hygiene rewordings carried false claims

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Two comment rewordings passed through from the first review were false: an abort-ordering claim and an unconditional framing claim; a causal claim about trim also contradicted the code.
- **Fix:** Corrected after checking the loop.
- **Files:** `commit 957cf96 (agent)`.

### I-096 Provider seam coupled to prompt framing

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** ProviderInterface.format, ProviderOptions.format, ContextFormat, the resolve helpers, and build(format) coupled framing into the provider wire boundary.
- **Fix:** The framing unit deleted the provider level and moved item-override resolution into InstructionManager.render, with the prompt-bytes control recorded first.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/contexts/instructions/InstructionManager.ts`, `commit 70c92d7 (agent)`.

### I-097 Tool message carried no call id

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A tool message did not name its call, so parallel calls correlated by position. Correlate run 1 stopped because Conversation.#create copies only named members and would drop the member.
- **Fix:** Correlate adds the call member through the relay projection, guard, and shaper, and the brief took ownership of #create.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/conversations/Conversation.ts`, `agent:src/core/providers/RelayProvider.ts`, `commit 363cc67 (agent)`.

### I-098 Relay call member refused by older relay servers

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Every relay tool message carries the call member, and a relay server older than its browser end refuses it with 400; attachImages drops call from a tagged user message.
- **Fix:** None yet. The relay projection still sends `call` on every tool message, and attachImages still drops `call` (and `thinking`) when it copies a message.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/providers/RelayProvider.ts`, `commit 363cc67 (agent)`, `agent:src/core/providers/RelayProvider.ts:102`, `agent:src/core/contexts/helpers.ts:257-268`.

### I-099 String tool result JSON-encoded before the model

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A successful string tool result was JSON-encoded into one escaped line, costing escape characters each tool turn (2 failed before, 134 passed after).
- **Fix:** A string result is the message content as is; other values keep JSON encoding.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/agents/Agent.ts`, `commit 65c706a (agent)`.

### I-100 mcp distribution test pins the quoted tool-result form

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** mcp's distribution test pins quoted tool-result lines near 1596 and 1732 and quotes loop-produced relay tool messages, which the string result and the call member change.
- **Fix:** None yet. The mcp lines are owed by plan unit 14, which is blocked on the agent release, and no mcp checkout exists on this host.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:49`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:104`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:163`.

### I-101 Six duplicated fragments across engines

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The mechanical audit found six duplicated fragments in src/core.
- **Fix:** The consolidate unit merged them.
- **Files:** `commit f7f6b7a (agent)`.

### I-102 Consolidate review changes

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The Opus review found chargeUsage returning a value both callers discard, MESSAGE_ROLES unfrozen, a ! in the releaseReader example, a false non-finite usage remark, and an assemble comment with no reason.
- **Fix:** All five applied; chargeUsage returns void and the remark names the Budget range error.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/agents/helpers.ts`, `agent:src/core/constants.ts`, `commit f7f6b7a (agent)`.

### I-103 Supervisor name collision gates the provider split

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The scaffold build refuses a staged owner set not contained in the host.json surface record, so splitting the provider engine and relay waits for supervisor to rename ProviderInterface, ProviderOptions, and RelayOptions and for a staged pre-publication agent.md.
- **Fix:** None yet. host.json still records ProviderInterface, ProviderOptions, and RelayOptions as owned by both agent and supervisor. No supervisor rename and no provider split has landed.
- **Files:** `scaffold:src/server/helpers.ts:1729-1747`, `scaffold:host.json:1489-1506`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:1046`.

### I-104 Judge cancel during decoding reported as a result

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Review claim 5: a read that trips the combined signal and still returns a value escaped the cancel path in #call.
- **Fix:** #call holds the decoded result, checks the signal, then returns; the regression case fails on the parent commit.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/providers/AgentJudge.ts`, `commit 3c094d7 (agent)`.

### I-105 Engine review claims 8 and 10 broken

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The engine review failed claims 5, 8, and 10; the content of 8 and 10 is not recorded.
- **Fix:** None yet. Claim 8 is settled: the comment that narrated `#call` is gone, and the `@example` on the error classes was refused by file convention. Claim 10's follow-up never landed. It asked for one exported helper for the bounded error excerpt and one for the deadline fold, with both engines routed through them, and `AgentJudge` and `AgentProvider` still each carry their own copy.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/providers/AgentJudge.ts:141`, `agent:src/core/providers/AgentJudge.ts:153`, `agent:src/core/providers/AgentProvider.ts:160`, `agent:src/core/providers/AgentProvider.ts:266`, `agent:src/core/providers/errors.ts:105`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:95`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/context.md:84`, `commit 3c094d7 (agent)`, `commit adef3a9 (agent)`, `commit f7f6b7a (agent)`.

### I-106 Scoped-out tool was callable

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The loop filtered a scope's allow-list into the advertised tools but dispatched every call the provider returned; 5 of 8 failing journey runs passed after those calls were dropped.
- **Fix:** Admission reads the allow-list snapshotted before advertising, out-of-scope calls get a denial message, answer-only scopes end on reply, and results merge by call position (agent 0.0.28).
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/agents/Agent.ts`, `commit c8ab2c5 (agent)`, `commit 7784837 (agent)`.

### I-107 System One guard over-validated

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The guard type-checked the server's confidence, choice, score, and legend, which the wire never reads, so confidence null failed a usable answer; the amendment review also asked for a single decoder guard, clause fixes, a titled example, and a fixture relabel.
- **Fix:** The guard checks the type and the distribution and the decoder checks each requested probability.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/validators.ts`, `commit 46a0b3d (agent)`.

### I-108 Judge request mutable while pending; structuredClone refused proxies

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A caller could mutate a question while a call was pending, and the structuredClone snapshot threw DataCloneError on Vue reactive requests, in the engine and in the judgment store.
- **Fix:** ask and the store own every input through JSON with copyJSON.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/helpers.ts`, `commit 46a0b3d (agent)`, `commit c6e3437 (agent)`.

### I-109 Lint failures on no-unused-vars and a toThrow message

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Lint failed on no-unused-vars and on a toThrow message.
- **Fix:** Fixed.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-110 Scope fold recommendation withdrawn

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** The Orchestrator recommended folding Scope, narrow, and ScopeManager into plain data because no fleet code switched saved scopes.
- **Fix:** Withdrawn: a registry of pre-made switchable modes is a real consumer, and scope and selection compose.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/contexts/scopes/Scope.ts`.

### I-111 Judge abort error in the wrong module

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The conversations module imported the judge abort error from providers, which the layout forbids.
- **Fix:** The abort error, its guard, and the JSON ownership helper moved to the root; a record JSON cannot carry throws ConversationError with code JUDGMENT.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/errors.ts`, `commit c6e3437 (agent)`.

### I-112 JSONSafe maps NoulCriteria to never

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** @orkestrel/test's JSONSafe maps the all-optional NoulCriteria to never, which forced roundTripJSON<unknown> at 4 sites and Object.freeze<JudgmentInput>.
- **Fix:** Explicit generics; the four sites drop the argument after @orkestrel/test carries a weak-type clause.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`, `commit 77f8640 (agent)`.

### I-113 Seam design assumed the agent appends the user message

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The agent appends no user message, so the loop must read the request as the last user message of the live view at entry.
- **Fix:** The seam brief skips selection when no user message exists, with ten design rulings fixed.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md`.

### I-114 Cancel from a fault listener landed after the fault

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A cancel issued inside the fault listener landed between the fault and the strict throw or the select event.
- **Fix:** Each select site re-reads the signal after emitting fault; six cases pin it, five failing on the unfixed code.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/agents/Agent.ts`, `commit e143907 (agent)`.

### I-115 Lint bans @ts-expect-error in the seam type proof

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The proof that narrow refuses select specified @ts-expect-error, which lint bans.
- **Fix:** An expectTypeOf assertion shown to fail the typecheck on its mutant.
- **Files:** `commit 78b734b (agent)`.

### I-116 Cancel at a zero iteration limit settled non-partial

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A cancel at the entry select site of a run with limit 0 never reached the loop's abort checks.
- **Fix:** The loop reads the signal before its first iteration.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/agents/Agent.ts`, `commit f28d222 (agent)`.

### I-117 Carve deviations kept at root

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** sanitizeToken, sanitizeUsage, and sumUsage sit at the root because providers uses two of them, and a layout rule conflicted with the two-importer count.
- **Fix:** Ruled that the layout table governs and a root kind file exists only when it holds a declaration.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/helpers.ts`, `commit 6ed210e (agent)`.

### I-118 Concurrent run appends or changes scope during select

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** A concurrent run can append during select, or a concurrent apply can change the next turn's scope for both runs.
- **Fix:** The tail check turns an append into a fault; the scope race is documented.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`.

### I-119 Handler calls context.apply during the entry select

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** A selection handler can call context.apply during the entry select and shape that turn's tools by side effect.
- **Fix:** One snapshot per turn is pinned; forbidding the side effect would change apply timing for every caller.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`.

### I-120 Gauge degenerate fit had no guard

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A degenerate marginal-rate fit had no guard in the measured harness.
- **Fix:** The port falls back to the measured scale.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/ledgers/Gauge.ts`, `commit ff5ebeb (agent)`.

### I-121 Three defects in the measured records module

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** An empty lookup did not replace an earlier result, a corrected correction revived the old value, and lookup identity depended on key order; the U3 port needed fixes before its gates were green.
- **Fix:** The port fixes all three and matches the measured module on every recorded fixture (parity 29 of 29).
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/ledgers/helpers.ts`, `agent:tests/setupLedger.ts`, `commit 07d0004 (agent)`.

### I-122 Port U4 classifier review failures

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Review failed claims 5 and 6: a judge-deadline rethrow, a shallow deterministic-failure match, and gated topics.
- **Fix:** The parity fixes landed with every gate green and 8 classifier tests.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/ledgers/Classifier.ts`.

### I-123 Ledger entity diverged from the measured method

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Two U6 review rounds found recall order, chain skipping, record line form, tail opening, fault pass-through, aborted partials, and calibrate's hold differing from the measured method, and the tail kept an empty seed call message.
- **Fix:** Each matches the measured method, a rule-unit test pins the chain exclusion, and both rounds are in the ledger (1,182 core tests, 96 guide tests).
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/ledgers/Ledger.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/u6-rereview-parity.md`, `commit 3d0a561 (agent)`, `commit 095f345 (agent)`.

### I-326 Port thinking behavior no measured arm ran

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The port reserves `predict` from the plan, the recall room, and the close rule, subtracts recorded thinking from `left` under replay `'none'`, keeps thinking out of the reply reserve, guards the rate's sign, and turns thinking off on every answer pass; no measured thinking arm ran this code (attack round, package F2).
- **Fix:** `records-port-plan.md` § Thinking departures lists them and rules that a live port series under thinking measures them before any claim of parity with a measured thinking arm.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/agent/records-port-plan.md`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/Gauge.ts`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/Ledger.ts`.

### I-332 The ported ledger sends requests the measured arm never sent

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The offline replay of the 8 `a5-records` runs through the port (U8, 2026-10-09) matched every judge body and the first request of all 80 goals, but 50 later agent bodies differ: recall and the answer note leave out seed assistant statements, ended pin lines, and repeated readings; the answer note keeps the call text on lookup lines; an earlier answer note is missing from a recall. The port plan lists none of these.
- **Fix:** None yet. Two blind lanes, the planner on Opus and the analyst on Astra, rule each departure a port fix or a listed departure under the rule that the package publishes the measured method; the port fixes follow, then the replay reruns.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/u8-report.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/fidelity-rulings-brief.md`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/helpers.ts:633`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/Ledger.ts`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/bench.mjs`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/probes/ledger-replay.test.ts` (not in a checkout).

## Agent docs and tests

### I-124 RelayStream construction failed on Node 22

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** RecordedProvider.stream in tests/setup.ts bound Symbol.asyncDispose, which a Node 22 async generator lacks, so RelayStream tests failed 3 of 8 and test:src:core 3 of 766.
- **Fix:** The wrapper disposes through its own return; 8 of 8 and 766 pass.
- **Files:** `agent:tests/setup.ts`, `agent:tests/src/core/providers/RelayStream.test.ts`, `commit c6e7da4 (agent)`.

### I-125 Review suggested a class @example

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** A review fix suggested a class @example, which conflicts with the file convention.
- **Fix:** Refused under the convention.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-126 Guide parity failed after the System One wire

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** test:guides failed on undocumented exports of the judge surface.
- **Fix:** The guide unit documented them (61 executed guide cases).
- **Files:** `agent:guides/agent.md`, `commit c3817a9 (agent)`.

### I-127 Missing copyJSON Surface row and a wrong table column count

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The guide lacked a Surface row for copyJSON and one table had the wrong column count.
- **Fix:** Fixed.
- **Files:** `agent:guides/agent.md`.

### I-128 Guide fence used a format key InstructionInput lacks

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The fence at guides/agent.md:371 wrote the item override as format; parity proved names but not compilation.
- **Fix:** The fence writes override and the guide suite executes the cascade fence.
- **Files:** `agent:guides/agent.md:371`, `commit 7d1b006 (agent)`.

### I-129 Framing and correlate review findings

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Astra's framing review found a non-exported name in the guide, two temporal phrases, redundant comments, a history remark, and an owed proof for the changed fence; the correlate review asked for one fixture doc block.
- **Fix:** Applied: export named, phrases reworded, cascade fence executed, fixture block states its coverage.
- **Files:** `agent:tests/guides.test.ts`, `commit 7d1b006 (agent)`, `commit 8889143 (agent)`.

### I-130 Carve left comments, tests, and guide bullets false

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The carve review asked for nine changes (four comments false after the split, a memory store test pointing at moved guards, an error-only test file, displaced headers, a guide index paragraph), and guide bullets described pre-split test files.
- **Fix:** All nine applied, the guide unit rewrote the bullets, the three referral rulings are in the plan, and R10 went to the guide unit.
- **Files:** `agent:guides/README.md`, `commit 0130041 (agent)`, `commit de6fb9e (scaffold)`.

### I-131 Guide clauses unpinned, undocumented, or false

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The guide had eleven unpinned behaviors and eight undocumented pins, clauses over three sentences, clause 24 claiming the measured prompt is what the provider receives, and two scope-timing sentences the seam made false.
- **Fix:** Clauses cut to at most three sentences, each pinned or cut, with 21 flagship cases and one scope-timing rule.
- **Files:** `agent:guides/agent.md`, `commit 6f3d2b6 (agent)`.

### I-132 Inflected tokens in exported description paragraphs

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** About twelve inflected code tokens remain in exported description paragraphs that guide parity compares.
- **Fix:** None yet. Inflected code tokens remain in exported description paragraphs on the port branch and in the guide Summary cells that parity compares. The guide unit has not swept them.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/conversations/factories.ts:81`, `agent:src/core/conversations/types.ts:75`, `agent:src/core/conversations/ConversationManager.ts:15`, `agent:guides/agent.md:978`.

### I-133 Seam review non-defect asks

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The seam review asked for the strict-failure matrix in shared fixtures, documented handler types, the strict doc naming the cancel exception, and three restating comments removed.
- **Fix:** All landed.
- **Files:** `commit e143907 (agent)`.

### I-134 Seam residual docs

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** AgentOptions.window TSDoc says current full prompt, Observing an agent lists no fault or select events, and untouched fences keep their figures.
- **Fix:** None yet. Both documented residuals I checked are still on the port branch head (4852d4c).
- **Files:** `agent:guides/agent.md`, `agent:src/core/agents/types.ts:377`, `agent:guides/agent.md:2089`.

### I-135 Selection review hygiene asks

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The selection review asked for mutant-failing cases on untested branches, two positional pins, a completion pin, parseConditionKey in a kind file, a constants-only test folded, dead assertions removed, and four Surface tables merged.
- **Fix:** All applied; the policy sweep accepts the parser kind file.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/contexts/parsers.ts`, `commit 9253b5d (agent)`.

### I-136 Falsify round small findings

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The round named two guide-proof changes, a clause 24 sentence, a threshold-1 pin, a stale compaction comment, and plan text on sanitizeToken.
- **Fix:** Batched into one amendment.
- **Files:** `commit f28d222 (agent)`.

### I-137 Guide sentence on the supersedes question was wrong

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The guide writer's sentence about when the supersedes question is asked was inaccurate.
- **Fix:** Corrected, every behavior sentence mapped to an executed test, four cases added (guide parity 96, later 101).
- **Files:** `agent:guides/agent.md`.

### I-138 Judge examples and comments broke writing rules

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Untitled examples, a fence showing only answer keys, a non-recorded request fixture, an invisible U+200B in a comment, and prose outside writing.md.
- **Fix:** Titled examples equal their fences, the recorded request is the fixture, TEV1_REQUEST is labelled synthetic, and the restating comment is gone.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md`.

### I-325 Thinking tests asserted the implementation and missed two paths

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The package's thinking tests counted getter reads instead of observing requests, no test showed the first pass and budgets unchanged with `think` absent, no test stripped thinking from the tail before the plan's cap, and the guide said every owner sends the messages it would send with no thinking recorded (attack round, package F1, F3, F4, F5).
- **Fix:** Commit 1117e23 adds the absent-think test, replaces the read counts with a getter switched after construction, adds the tail-strip test with a non-empty briefing, and narrows the guide sentence with an executed assertion for the ledger case. No `src/` change.
- **Files:** `agent:tests/src/core/ledgers/Ledger.test.ts`, `agent:tests/src/core/providers/RelayStream.test.ts`, `agent:guides/agent.md`, `agent:tests/guides.test.ts`, `commit 1117e23 (agent)`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/t7-attack-fix-brief.md`.

### I-333 The replay probe over-accepted on four paths

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The review of the U8 probe found it labels stale removals on recall and digest routes as R2a, answers a re-asked held judgment with a body it built itself, serves the last twin again when a body repeats, reads two setup values back from the recording, and drops `schema` and non-text message members before comparing.
- **Fix:** None yet. Unit u8b fixes each path and labels every unlisted body by cause; the review runs again after it.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/u8-review.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/u8b-probe-fix-brief.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/probes/ledger-replay-compare.ts` (not in a checkout).

## Ollama and daemon

### I-139 Mica first load and question latency

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Mica's first load took over 120 s and caused one abort; per question about 3.5 s short and about 60 s per 4k-token state. Records disagree on cold load: 106 s (refine.md:24) against about 231 s (small-models.md).
- **Fix:** Calls set num_ctx and a long timeout, and both models were warmed with a 4 h keep-alive; the two load readings are not reconciled.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md:24`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/small-models.md`.

### I-140 Ollama 0.40 refuses Mica on the System One path

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Ollama 0.40.0 returns HTTP 400 does not support decision for Mica on systemone, while tev1 answers there.
- **Fix:** OllamaJudge reads Mica through a raw generate call with Mica's render byte for byte; the live deletion reading came within 0.005 of 0.9884.
- **Files:** `ollama:src/core/OllamaJudge.ts`, `commit 27a8c46 (ollama)`.

### I-141 top_logprobs capped at 20

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Ollama hard-caps top_logprobs at 20 (HTTP 400 past it), so only labels A to T of the 255-label codebook are reachable.
- **Fix:** The daemon's cap of 20 remains. The judge bounds the problem: it refuses a choice question with more than 20 candidates, or a score question with more than 10 levels, with `QUESTION` before inference. So it never asks for a label the top-logprob list cannot hold. The label set is A to Z then a to z, and only A to T are reachable, as documented.
- **Files:** `ollama:src/core/constants.ts`, `ollama:src/core/constants.ts:27`, `ollama:src/core/helpers.ts:111`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md:253`.

### I-142 hf.co pulls use an Ollama Go template

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** A hf.co pull gets a Go template chosen from GGUF metadata, not the GGUF's own Jinja template.
- **Fix:** The judge never goes through Ollama's chat template. `OllamaJudge` sends Mica's ChatML prompt, rendered byte for byte, to /api/generate with `raw: true`, so neither the daemon's Go template nor the GGUF's Jinja template touches the judge readout. The Ollama behavior itself is external and unchanged. The desk's unguided Mica contrast still goes through /api/chat under the daemon template.
- **Files:** `ollama:src/core/OllamaJudge.ts:122`, `ollama:src/core/helpers.ts:91`, `desk:app/server/Desk.ts:100`, `desk:app/server/Desk.ts:268`, `commit 27a8c46 (ollama)`.

### I-143 Ollama judge review findings

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Prompt-render gaps for an empty criterion and Unicode digits, and an identity without the sampling options, plus naming and keepAlive asks.
- **Fix:** Identity carries sorted effective options and the render matches; the live case passed three times.
- **Files:** `ollama:src/core/OllamaJudge.ts`, `ollama:src/core/helpers.ts`, `commit 331a817 (ollama)`.

### I-144 Packed ollama nested agent 0.0.25

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Ollama required agent ^0.0.25, so the packed ollama nested the judge-less 0.0.25 in the desk.
- **Fix:** The manifest requires ^0.0.26 and the judge import resolves the root agent.
- **Files:** `ollama:package.json`, `commit 0c6f3fe (ollama)`.

### I-145 Ollama live baseline red on three cases

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The live baseline finished 73 passed and 3 failed in 29 min: store paging, checkout journey, and the 30-turn ZEPHYR sentinel, each on qwen3.5:2b over 3 attempts, with gates competing for CPU.
- **Fix:** The red baseline came from the agent-0.0.27 release window. Afterwards the other session landed the store-harness fixes on ollama main: thinking on, the search-box prompt, the seeded journey cart, and ending tool access after the first successful call. It then published 0.0.21 and 0.0.22, and the whole live service suite read 76 passed, the same count as the red baseline's 73 plus 3.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/release.md:53`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/release.md:125`, `commit 058e770 (ollama)`, `commit 5e3cdbf (ollama)`.

### I-146 Held ollama store repair not on origin/main

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The held ollama 0.0.21 store repair stays on the user's machine and is not on origin/main.
- **Fix:** The held work was pushed. Ollama main was pushed at 058e770 with the 25 previously local commits, and 0.0.21 was published from it on 2026-10-07. 58c08d8 is an ancestor of the published and merged head.
- **Files:** `commit 58c08d8 (ollama)`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/release.md:52`, `commit 058e770 (ollama)`.

### I-147 Ollama branch tracking ref showed unpushed commits

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The stop hook reported unpushed commits because the fetch refspec tracks only main.
- **Fix:** Tracking ref restored and head ea0b257 pushed.
- **Files:** `commit ea0b257 (ollama)`.

### I-148 Ollama daemon gone or detached

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The daemon process died once, and after a container restart it was left detached.
- **Fix:** Restarted with nohup and setsid.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-149 Mica runner OOM-killed beside the agent model

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Mica at num_ctx 8,192 holds 7.2 GB beside the 2.6 GB qwen runner on a 15 GB host; the kernel logged 30 OOM kills and all 9 selection faults on 2026-10-08 were these kills.
- **Fix:** The daemon runs with OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1 at the cost of a swap per goal (about 84 s per briefing run); the fault path falls back to the unselected view.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/REPORT.md:49`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/JUDGE.md:38`.

### I-150 Concurrent probe forced per-call reloads

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** A second client on the daemon forced a model reload on every call at about 12 s each.
- **Fix:** One client at a time on the daemon.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-151 Ollama merge conflict on package.json and lock

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Merging origin/main into the ollama branch conflicted on package.json and the lockfile.
- **Fix:** Took main's published 0.0.22 pins (agent ^0.0.29, scaffold ^0.0.97) and pushed.
- **Files:** `ollama:package.json`, `commit 35e4b3a (ollama)`.

### I-152 Ollama dist used by the judge not rebuilt

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The ollama dist the bench judge loads was not rebuilt after the re-pin.
- **Fix:** None recorded. No record or log shows `/home/user/ollama/dist` rebuilt after the re-pin. The re-pin commits touch only package.json and the lockfile, and dist imports @orkestrel/agent as an external that resolves to the installed 0.0.29, so a rebuild might change nothing. That is unconfirmed until someone rebuilds and diffs.
- **Files:** `ollama:dist/src/core/index.js`, `commit ea0b257 (ollama)`, `commit 35e4b3a (ollama)`.

### I-153 Judge abort class identity fails across builds

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** isJudgeAbortError tests class identity, and the Mica judge threw classes from agent 0.0.28, so partial usage and the pending key were lost on a judge abort.
- **Fix:** The harness matches by class name; ollama re-pins to the agent release.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/AUDIT.md:25`.

### I-154 Desk loads Mica at 8,192 context beside the agent

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The desk loads Mica at num_ctx 8,192 beside the agent and runs both at once, while the bounded state needs 4,096.
- **Fix:** None yet. The desk still configures Mica, and its own drafts, at num_ctx 8,192.
- **Files:** `desk:app/server/constants.ts:14`, `desk:app/server/Desk.ts:63`, `desk:app/server/Desk.ts:275`.

### I-155 Ollama judge hard-codes Mica's template and labels

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Qwen3-Reranker 0.6B, the closest published fit, is not a drop-in judge.
- **Fix:** None yet. OllamaJudgeOptions exposes no template or label option, so the judge cannot host Qwen3-Reranker's prompt or lowercase labels.
- **Files:** `ollama:src/core/OllamaJudge.ts`, `ollama:src/core/types.ts:103`, `ollama:src/core/helpers.ts:91`.

### I-156 Ollama 4,096 default context too small for the judge view

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The judge view grows past the 4,096-token default as goals accumulate.
- **Fix:** The judge context length is set on each call.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-157 Ollama message mapper drops thinking

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The mapper forwards images but not thinking, so the agent's replay policy has no effect on the Ollama wire, although Ollama 0.40 reads input thinking.
- **Fix:** None yet. mapMessages forwards role, content, tool_calls, and images but not `thinking`. So the replay policy on the agent port branch (`ProviderOptions.replay`) still has no effect on the Ollama wire.
- **Files:** `ollama:src/core/helpers.ts:268`, `ollama:src/core/helpers.ts:257`.

### I-158 Chat requests without truncate false drop messages

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** An 18,035-token prompt at a 6,144 window returned prompt_eval_count 25 with no error; the daemon drops leading messages.
- **Fix:** The harness sends truncate false (Ollama 0.40.0).
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`.

### I-159 Logprob readout fails on duplicate top tokens

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** 8 seed questions fail on every attempt with invalid or duplicate top logprob token, and the ledger re-asked 5 of them at every select site.
- **Fix:** Failures are held in a failure store as undecided; the root cause near ollama helpers.ts:151 is unmeasured.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench3/README.md:698`.

### I-160 Mica behavior at its 8,192-token limit unmeasured

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The official server rejects over-length input with 400; the Ollama daemon's behavior at the limit is unmeasured.
- **Fix:** None yet. No over-length probe against the daemon has run. The records still list it as an unmeasured probe to run before the desk pins OllamaJudgeOptions.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:578`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:173`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md:584`.

### I-161 Ollama tool-message wire shape unread

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The /api/chat tool-message shape was not read, so forwarding the call member changes bytes unmeasured.
- **Fix:** None yet. Unit 13 (`ollama`) is still blocked, and mapMessages forwards no call member on tool messages, so the wire question has not been read or decided.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:103`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:169`, `ollama:src/core/helpers.ts:257`.

### I-162 Framing deletion reaches OllamaOptions.format

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The ollama provider passes options.format to the base provider, which no longer has that level, and a consumer that set a provider format sees other system-block bytes.
- **Fix:** None yet. OllamaProvider still forwards options.format to the base provider, while the agent port's ProviderOptions no longer declares `format`. The break lands when ollama re-pins to the release carrying 70c92d7, and unit 13 remains blocked.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`, `commit 70c92d7 (agent)`, `ollama:src/core/OllamaProvider.ts:47`, `ollama:src/core/types.ts:44`, `agent:src/core/providers/types.ts:231`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:168`.

### I-163 Queue not hoisted; page import map failed

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The lockfile placed queue 0.0.16 under agent and workflow with no top-level copy, failing 8 cases in tests/service/page.test.ts.
- **Fix:** npm dedupe hoisted the one version.
- **Files:** `commit 058e770 (ollama)`.

## Ollama store harness

### I-164 Provider sent think false; 2B ran reflexive

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The provider sends think false by default and the harness never set it, so qwen3.5 ran without thinking; a later ruling measures 2B with think false first.
- **Fix:** The harness runs with thinking on and a 1,024 cap; the think-false-first ruling stays recorded.
- **Files:** `ollama:tests/setupService.ts`, `commit 01e0513 (ollama)`, `commit a89662b (scaffold)`.

### I-165 Greedy sampling regressed the thinking 2B

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Plain greedy sampling passed search on 4 of 8 ports at 15.1 s per attempt against 16 of 16 at 7.2 s with the model card's penalties.
- **Fix:** The harness keeps the model's own sampling penalties.
- **Files:** `ollama:tests/setupService.ts`, `commit e7bdefd (ollama)`.

### I-166 Search instruction read as page search

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** With thinking on, 'Search for kettle' read as find on this page and the model read the catalogue.
- **Fix:** 'Use the search box to search for kettle' passes 15 of 16 and 16 of 16 ports.
- **Files:** `ollama:tests/setupStore.ts`, `commit de1a7b1 (ollama)`.

### I-167 Edit call omitted the journey name

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** 'Edit place-order in one call' sent the edits alone on 7 of 16 ports, and 5 of 8 after a rewrite.
- **Fix:** 'Edit the journey place-order in one call' carried it on 3 of 3 failing replay ports; browser 0.0.27 defaults to the only saved journey.
- **Files:** `ollama:tests/setupStore.ts`, `commit 949b28a (ollama)`.

### I-168 Journey opening turn spent the shared call budget

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The opening turn spent the shared 8-call budget before the model answered, so every 2B attempt was partial.
- **Fix:** A store task sets the calls one user turn allows and the opening turn takes its own budget.
- **Files:** `ollama:tests/setupStore.ts`, `commit 3c6345d (ollama)`.

### I-169 2B called journeys with no arguments

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The 2B called journeys with no arguments, was refused, and read the page seven times to the turn limit.
- **Fix:** The journey prompt teaches calling journeys with from 1.
- **Files:** `commit 5cfa5ed (ollama)`.

### I-170 Type-before-click order lost searches

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** With type named first, 2B search passed 6 of 16 ports.
- **Fix:** The click sentence comes first: 15 of 16.
- **Files:** `commit 81adc74 (ollama)`.

### I-171 Refusal bound reset on any success

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A model alternating a listing with a refused save never reached the bound and spent the turn budget.
- **Fix:** Refusals count across the user turn, successes included.
- **Files:** `commit fc776b6 (ollama)`.

### I-172 Second replay after a refused save

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** A save after a successful replay was refused with 'Answer the user.', which the model read as the user asking again, so the store held three orders.
- **Fix:** After a later turn's first successful call the context takes the answer scope; the residual is model behavior.
- **Files:** `ollama:tests/setupStore.ts`, `commit 82a6acb (ollama)`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/small-models.md`.

### I-173 Exposed references cleared on refused actions

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The reference set cleared on every action call, refused ones included, so the 2B cart path failed the reference predicate.
- **Fix:** A failed call keeps the set; a successful action starts the next set from its window.
- **Files:** `commit b45eae7 (ollama)`.

### I-174 Paging and policy window defects

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Paging accepted a search that left its window, '1 line matches' counted as productive, and browser 07a906e never ended a window on a heading.
- **Fix:** The first-row check refuses a moved window and policy windows open at the heading boundary.
- **Files:** `commit b3083aa (ollama)`, `commit debc48c (ollama)`.

### I-175 Store harness out of step with browser 0.0.27 texts

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Carried links, gone-element and type refusals, and save text changed in browser 0.0.27.
- **Fix:** Re-recorded.
- **Files:** `commit 20dec5b (ollama)`.

### I-176 Store harness audit findings

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The proof held probe dumps, dependency-only assertions, and self-derived expectations; 180 audit findings were confirmed.
- **Fix:** Interfaces moved into the setup module, helpers centralized, and the proof cleaned.
- **Files:** `ollama:tests/setupStore.test.ts`, `commit e8f29f1 (ollama)`.

### I-177 Optional from argument on read

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Search fell from 16 of 16 to 6 and paging from 16 to 0.
- **Fix:** Rejected; any regression rejects a change.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md`.

### I-178 Rewording tool descriptions flips the first call

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** Byte-identical rewordings flipped the 2B's first call on 3 of 4 ports, and rewording click and type turned every search into a read.
- **Fix:** Rejected; a description change is the last lever and is measured with thinking on.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/small-models.md`.

### I-179 Refusals naming two exits loop

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Two refusals pointing at each other made a 36-call loop.
- **Fix:** A refusal names the one next call.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md`.

### I-180 Checkout from an empty cart

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The model's reasoning shows a checkout attempted from an empty cart, read as a fixture confusion.
- **Fix:** The journey task's store starts with the named product in the cart, so the model no longer reads checkout as a mistake. The fixture fix is ollama commit 414e444, on main.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/small-models.md`, `ollama:tests/setupStore.ts:1472`, `commit 414e444 (ollama)`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/small-models.md:17`.

### I-181 Empty journey refusal names no journey

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** With no readable journey and a faulted entry, edit's refusal reads 'Edit requires journey, one of ;'.
- **Fix:** None yet. The record keeps it as a degenerate store state, "recorded, not repaired". The code that builds the refusal is not in any checkout here, so I could not confirm a repair.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/small-models.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/small-models.md:63`, `ollama:tests/setupStore.ts:1207-1227`.

### I-182 Live store attempts shared one browser context

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Before commit 90901da the live store attempts did not each run in their own browser context. The symptom is not recorded; the issue is read from the commit title.
- **Fix:** Each live store attempt runs in its own browser context (2026-10-04).
- **Files:** `ollama:tests/setupStore.ts`, `commit 90901da (ollama)`.

## Desk

### I-183 Workflow fault slot collided with a fixture question id

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The protocol unit's workflow fault used the slot name policy, which a fixture question also uses.
- **Fix:** The slot is named workflow.
- **Files:** `commit 98b1fe4 (desk)`.

### I-184 Desk design and law reviews failed

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The design review failed claims 3, 4, 5, and 8 and the law review claim 4.
- **Fix:** The finish unit applied all twelve rulings, and captures were read in both modes.
- **Files:** `commit a9336e6 (desk)`.

### I-185 Desk contrast below floor

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Measured in Chromium: tabs 4.27 light, toggle class 4.25, and meter track 2.56 dark.
- **Fix:** Repaired; the journey measures both modes at three widths, text clears 4.5:1 and meters 3:1 (lowest 3.50 light, 3.99 dark).
- **Files:** `desk:app/vue/desk.css`, `desk:tests/app/vue/integration.test.ts`.

### I-186 Desk end-state copy misreported

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Unstarted questions read 'The call ended before a result', and a dropped stream showed a raw TypeError in the banner.
- **Fix:** They read 'Not asked', a dropped stream names itself, and renderLimit names the limit.
- **Files:** `commit a9336e6 (desk)`.

### I-187 Third policy phase named Judge

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The phase collided with the Judgment stage on the same page, and step headings still said Judge after the strip became Score.
- **Fix:** Named Score.
- **Files:** `desk:app/vue/Policy.vue`, `commit 11fcc42 (desk)`.

### I-188 Qualifier sentence contradicted its refund gate

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** It said 'Eligible. Refund heard and the policy supports it.' in a turn where the refund gate fired.
- **Fix:** The sentence follows the applied restriction.
- **Files:** `desk:app/vue/Policy.vue`, `commit 11fcc42 (desk)`.

### I-189 Derived reading unlabelled; lead contradicted Mica's text

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The derived reading carried no label, and the lead said Mica writes no text while the unguided contrast shows Mica's text.
- **Fix:** Closed by the finish unit.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-190 Desk law-lane test gaps

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Three exported derivations lacked tests, the 576 breakpoint was unasserted, instrument controls bypassed the mounted screen, the transport fixture never split an SSE frame or answered non-OK, and page constants restated policy catalogs.
- **Fix:** Closed; catalogs live in app/core/constants.ts with policy output unchanged across seven fixtures.
- **Files:** `desk:app/core/constants.ts`.

### I-191 Refused-refund wording finding

- **Status:** rejected.
- **Issue:** A review objected to treating a refused refund as 'no refund requested'.
- **Fix:** Refused; the policy keeps it and shows its default note.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-192 Desk decision stored derivable members

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Decision stored relationship, label, name, probability, confidence, and expectation, and a level's display name was copied from its criterion.
- **Fix:** Decision carries reading, absent on a refusal; the display name is derived and ScoreSpec.names deleted.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-193 Pre-existing lint findings in policies.ts

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** lint:check reported 29 no-misplaced-function findings in app/core/policies.ts (30 in one reading).
- **Fix:** The module-scope functions moved out and lint:check reads 0.
- **Files:** `commit 3c2d726 (desk)`.

### I-194 Desk browser tests fail before the campaign

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The journey fails at integration.test.ts:47 and App.test.ts finds two buttons named 'Payouts ticket', so no capture shows a decision card.
- **Fix:** The desk page rebuild in commits 11fcc42 and a9336e6 rewrote the journey and the page test. The re-pin in commit e9d6ca8 recorded the journey green with 66 captures. The capture portfolio in the desk includes rendered Judgment decision cards, so the issue's consequence, that no capture shows a decision card, no longer holds.
- **Files:** `desk:tests/app/vue/integration.test.ts:47`, `desk:tests/app/vue/App.test.ts`, `desk:tests/app/vue/App.test.ts:34`, `desk:tests/app/vue/App.test.ts:190`, `desk:app/vue/App.vue:171`, `desk:app/core/templates.ts:20`, `desk:tmp/captures/states/settled-light--desktop.png`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:82`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md:537`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md:593`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:980`, `commit 11fcc42 (desk)`, `commit a9336e6 (desk)`, `commit e9d6ca8 (desk)`.

### I-195 Two agent copies broke the judge-abort guard

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Ollama 0.0.21 pins agent ^0.0.28 and the lock kept its nested entry, so the override was ignored and the cancellation case at Desk.test.ts:203 failed.
- **Fix:** A scoped override with the nested entry removed, dropped after ollama 0.0.22 pinned ^0.0.29.
- **Files:** `desk:package.json`, `commit ae57ae3 (desk)`, `commit 3c2d726 (desk)`.

### I-196 Scaffold 0.0.97 bans module-scope functions in data files

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** policies.ts held 27 module-scope functions, blocking the desk bump.
- **Fix:** Moved unchanged to app/core/helpers.ts with their tests; lint, format, and check read 0.
- **Files:** `desk:app/core/helpers.ts`, `commit 3c2d726 (desk)`.

### I-197 Desk helper naming follow-ups

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** pinBrief, renderSubject, and buildLines reuse fleet names, nine helpers are not verb-first, and settlePolicy holds workflow state in helpers.ts.
- **Fix:** None yet. No naming round has run, and every name the issue lists is still in place.
- **Files:** `desk:app/core/helpers.ts`, `desk:app/core/helpers.ts:914`, `desk:app/core/helpers.ts:1433`, `desk:app/core/helpers.ts:1521`, `desk:app/core/helpers.ts:1675`, `desk:app/vue/helpers.ts:638`, `desk:app/server/Desk.ts:133`.

### I-198 Desk git rm refused a modified file

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** git rm refused to remove a modified file.
- **Fix:** git rm -f.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-199 Desk journeys timed out under CPU contention

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Journey tests timed out while the bench ran.
- **Fix:** SIGSTOP the bench node, run the journeys (6 of 6), then SIGCONT.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-200 Desk shared fixtures cannot sit in tests/setup.ts

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Exporting from tests/setup.ts needs a root proof and a setup project, but scaffold 0.0.92 and 0.0.94 plan no app:vue project for the desk, so repair would drop the Vue project.
- **Fix:** Fixtures live in tests/app/fixtures.ts; align the app selection, register app:vue, add the root proof, and move them back.
- **Files:** `desk:tests/app/fixtures.ts`, `desk:tests/setup.ts`.

### I-201 Desk keeps no conversation history

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Every desk agent call sees one user message, so the method needs a conversation for briefing and records to project.
- **Fix:** None yet. The planned fix is the desk toggle and model selector unit, and it has not run.
- **Files:** `desk:app/server/Desk.ts:277`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:923`.

### I-202 Select seam ships before its desk consumer

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** Desk-select runs after the re-pin, so the select seam ships first and a desk defect becomes a patch release.
- **Fix:** None. This is a recorded trade-off the user chose by instruction, not a defect a measurement dropped. It stays live until desk-select runs.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:192`, `desk:app/server/Desk.ts`.

## Session and dispatch

### I-015 ChatGPT share page returned only the title

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** WebFetch returned only the page title for the share link, and the first recursive turbo-stream decoder hit RecursionError.
- **Fix:** The payload was fetched with curl and decoded by a two-pass iterative hydrator.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-016 Cursor Grok bench dark on an invalid model id

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The Cursor bench stayed dark with CURSOR_GROK_MODEL=cursor-grok-4.7-high, an invalid model id.
- **Fix:** Launched with --model grok-4.7-xhigh, the id the user named.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-017 Shell working directory shared across Bash calls

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The cwd resets between Bash calls and parallel calls share one cwd, so gates ran in the wrong checkout and desk re-pin edits landed in scaffold.
- **Fix:** Use absolute paths, git -C, and npm --prefix, or chain the commands in one call; the desk edits were redone alone.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-018 Large tool outputs saved to files

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Large tool outputs were saved to tool-result files instead of shown inline, and the planning printout exceeded the output limit.
- **Fix:** Outputs are read in bounded slices, and the planning output was split into four JSON files.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-019 brief.ts --check flags path tokens in briefs

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The brief check flagged relative example paths, branch names, files a unit creates, module directory tokens such as agents/, and backticked URL paths.
- **Fix:** Briefs use absolute or host-copy paths for existing files, name files a unit creates in prose, write URL paths plain, and run the check from the target checkout.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.agents/skills/orkestrel-dispatch/scripts/brief.ts`.

### I-020 Python measurement probe violated AGENTS.md

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The probe tools/measure.py was Python, but AGENTS.md requires scripts in TypeScript run by Node.
- **Fix:** Replaced by tmp/probes/measure.ts with a known-answer control, deleted at acceptance.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-021 Design lanes killed by an interrupted wait

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The user's interrupt of a long wait command stopped both background design lanes about 1 min after launch, with no answer written.
- **Fix:** Both lanes were relaunched: the subjective lane on Opus and the objective lane on Astra through a journaled codex exec.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-022 Wait exited early on a false hand-back match

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A grep for SubagentHandback matched the tool definition in the lane transcript and reported a hand-back that had not happened.
- **Fix:** Waits rely on the lane's completion notification or assistant tool_use lines.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-023 prettier --check false positive

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** npx prettier --check reported failures, but the repository formats with oxfmt.
- **Fix:** Use npm run format:check.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-024 Stop hook demanded commits while work was in progress

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The stop hook repeatedly asked for a commit while a draft record or a writing unit was unfinished.
- **Fix:** The draft record was committed with an interim sentence and then amended; a running unit's half-written files were not committed.
- **Files:** `commit 4d1d74f (scaffold)`, `commit 8772db7 (scaffold)`.

### I-025 Codex units stopped under deviation contracts

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Three units stopped on their deviation contracts: ollama-fix on README scope, desk-fix on tests/setup.test.ts scope, and desk-protocol because the brief put watchTask in policies.ts instead of the function-kind file.
- **Fix:** The briefs were amended (watchTask in app/core/helpers.ts) and the units relaunched.
- **Files:** `desk:app/core/helpers.ts`.

### I-026 Fable subagents used against a standing instruction

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The design round's subagents ran on Fable, which the user forbids as a subagent.
- **Fix:** Relaunched on Opus; every spawn carries an explicit model.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-027 Running design workflow stopped on a misread instruction

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The Orchestrator read 'let the workflow complete' and 'do not run Fable as a subagent' as one instruction and stopped the run, losing three Fable lanes, the law-audit lane, and the refuters.
- **Fix:** Two Fable lanes were recovered from the journal as blind opinions and the Opus run completed. Never stop a workflow the user wants completed.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-028 Reviewers and checkers dispatched without a shell

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A shell-less reviewer was asked to run git diff and judged from the writer's report instead of the diff.
- **Fix:** Every review and checker receives a diff and status file or worktree copies.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-029 Workflow refused scriptPath after a cwd change

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The Workflow tool refused scriptPath after the working directory changed.
- **Fix:** The script was sent inline.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-030 Two workflows stopped against user direction

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The Orchestrator stopped two workflows after the user said not to stop them or lose work.
- **Fix:** Resumed by run id, with scripts copied unchanged to tmp/units/ because the tool refused the original path.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-031 Falsify lane stopped early on a plan-and-code conflict

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The Astra falsify brief's stop clause ended the round on a plan-and-code conflict and endorsed nothing.
- **Fix:** The clause makes a conflict a FAILS verdict, and the lane was rerun against the fixed head.
- **Files:** `commit c8ca0f5 (agent)`, `commit af20e1f (scaffold)`.

### I-032 pkill -f killed the Orchestrator's own shell

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** pkill -f matched the shell's own command line and killed it (exit 144), twice.
- **Fix:** Kill by pid only (ps -eo pid,args with an exact match, or pgrep -x).
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-033 Scaffold main pushes refused by the other session's commits

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The other session's fleet wave pushed scaffold main during this work, so fast-forwards were refused.
- **Fix:** Fetch and merge main before each fast-forward.
- **Files:** `commit de6fb9e (scaffold)`.

### I-034 Research synthesis returned a verdict instead of analysis

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The synthesis dispatched to a reviewer persona returned a verdict, not the analysis.
- **Fix:** The Orchestrator wrote JUDGE.md; later syntheses use the opus role with Write.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/JUDGE.md`.

### I-035 Workflow script parse error from an apostrophe

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A workflow script failed to parse because of an apostrophe in a description.
- **Fix:** The apostrophe was removed.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-036 Shell quoting failed on an apostrophe

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** A shell command broke on an apostrophe in its quoted text.
- **Fix:** The edit was made with the Edit tool.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-037 sed delimiter clashed with the pattern

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A sed command with a # delimiter clashed with the ###? pattern.
- **Fix:** The edit was made with the Edit tool.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-038 Scaffold overwrite exited 1 on typescript and vitest majors

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The scaffold 0.0.98 overwrite exited 1 because the audit flagged newer typescript and vitest majors on the registry.
- **Fix:** The overwrite was applied anyway in agent commit d2a968a, and its gates passed. The user ruled on 2026-10-07 to keep the TypeScript 6 and Vitest 4 majors, so the audit keeps flagging TypeScript 7 and Vitest 5 until the user moves the toolchain.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/release.md:81`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/release.md:84`, `agent:package.json:89`, `agent:package.json:95`, `agent:package.json:97`, `commit 3da00b6 (agent)`, `commit d2a968a (agent)`.

### I-039 Stale catalog agent file blocked scaffold overwrite

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A stale catalog agent file stopped scaffold overwrite from restoring the floor body.
- **Fix:** The stale file was deleted and overwrite restored the body.
- **Files:** `agent:.claude/agents/orkestrel.md`, `commit 46a75eb (agent)`.

### I-040 Reply-fix workflow stopped before editing

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The first reply-fix workflow was stopped before it edited anything.
- **Fix:** Relaunched as reply-modes by user direction.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-041 Fix unit wiped the session scratchpad

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** At 22:25 on 2026-10-08 a fix unit deleted everything in the scratchpad: the page source, the npm 11 install, the daemon log, and research notes.
- **Fix:** The page was recovered from an Artifact read into results/lab, and every later brief forbids deleting files the unit did not create.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/lab/context-lab.html`.

### I-042 Live runs launched detached without completion notice

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Runs started with plain & or detached gave no completion notice, twice, against the rule that live runs go through launch.ts.
- **Fix:** Every live run launches through launch.ts in the background, running run-one.ts.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v7/tools/run-one.ts`.

### I-043 Bash per-run runner run-one.sh

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The per-run runner was a bash script, which AGENTS.md forbids for a one-off tool.
- **Fix:** Replaced by run-one.ts (exit 3 on cold-start failure, 64 on usage) from a4-refined-v7 on; run-one.sh was deleted.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v7/tools/run-one.ts`.

### I-044 Verifier diff used require on a .pre-negation file

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The scorer-revert verifier's field diff used require() on a .pre-negation backup and misread it.
- **Fix:** The Orchestrator reran the diff with JSON.parse: check.mjs exit 0, scorer-check.ts 26 of 26.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/variants/check.mjs`.

### I-045 cite.ts reported 37 unresolved citations

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** cite.ts showed 37 unresolved citations because the Astra report used Markdown links.
- **Fix:** Targets were checked by hand; later briefs require plain path:line.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-046 Dispatches broke routing rules

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Dispatches broke rules on roles, efforts, bash, launch.ts, and engines; Opus held objective lanes while the Astra bench was live and unprobed, unrecorded at the time.
- **Fix:** Misroutes and the substitution are recorded in the routing ledger; Astra re-audits ran as the user asked.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ledger.md`.

### I-047 Orchestrator edits not reviewed by a separate engine

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** For Thinking T2 and T3 and Port U1 the Orchestrator edited comments or test lines after the lane returned.
- **Fix:** The T4 objective review covers T2 and T3; the Port U1 edits were not separately reviewed.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ledger.md`.

### I-048 Series driver kill refused; cap flag installed mid-series

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Killing the running series driver to change the thinking cap was refused, and the --think-predict flag landed between runs, changing the harness sha256 mid-series.
- **Fix:** The t2 runs stay as the pilot, and the flag default leaves request bodies byte-identical.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md:26`.

### I-049 .next extension broke verifier gates

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The verifier could not load the staged bench.mjs.next for --think-predict.
- **Fix:** Gates ran through temporary .mjs copies (node --check exit 0, --check-ledger exit 0), a form the scripts rule bars, and the flag was installed with no run active.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-050 U4 brief caused a nested codex attempt

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The U4 brief text 'Executor: BRIDGE_DRIVER' made Astra try a nested codex.
- **Fix:** Rewritten as BENCH_ENGINE.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/u4-ledger-classifier-brief.md`.

### I-051 Unit gates missed root typecheck failures

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Port U1 gates omitted tsc --project tsconfig.json; a second verifier found an exhaustive-keys failure and a forbidden explicit briefing: undefined, and the checker found an as never[] assertion.
- **Fix:** The Orchestrator fixed the test lines (commit 99cdca6), and every later gate list adds the root typecheck, lint:check, and format:check.
- **Files:** `agent:tsconfig.json`, `commit 99cdca6 (agent)`.

### I-052 Scout refused a dispatch with no map path

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The scout role refuses a dispatch with no orkestrel-scout map, which the thinking-research dispatch did not supply.
- **Fix:** The planner read the code; scout dispatches run the scout map script with --out tmp/units/UNIT-map.txt first.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.claude/agents/scout.md:16`, `scaffold:.agents/skills/orkestrel-scout/SKILL.md`.

### I-053 U6 fix brief paraphrased the recall order wrongly

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The first U6 fix brief stated the recall order wrongly.
- **Fix:** The second review caught it and the brief was corrected.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/u6-fix-brief.md`.

### I-054 Gate agent wrote files outside its scope

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The answer-run gate agent reported writing files where it was not allowed to.
- **Fix:** None recorded. No record names the files the gate agent wrote or rules on the scope breach.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ledger.md:52-54`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/frozen-harness-audit-verdict.md:7`.

### I-055 Blind audit stopped mid-run; relaunched on Haiku

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The in-flight blind audit of 56 failures stopped, so none of its verdicts count.
- **Fix:** Relaunched with every auditor on Haiku 5.5, two readers plus a tiebreak; rubric grading also moved to Haiku 5.5.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-056 Concurrent fix unit blocked briefing runs

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** A fix unit was editing the briefing harness, so a briefing run could load a half-written file.
- **Fix:** Full-view copies ran first, and briefing copies resumed after the fix proved the Round A setting unchanged.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-057 Framing amendment spots lost with the review worktree

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The review worktree was removed before the framing amendments landed.
- **Fix:** The spots were located again and landed as one follow-up commit after correlate.
- **Files:** `commit 7d1b006 (agent)`.

### I-058 Judgments lane stopped on parity items outside scope

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The Astra judgments lane stopped on two parity items outside its scope.
- **Fix:** The Orchestrator applied them and the unit landed.
- **Files:** `commit 424f7ca (agent)`.

### I-059 Scaffold policy test needs a build

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The scaffold policy test fails on a checkout without a build.
- **Fix:** Run npm run build first.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-060 Registry versions differ from the checkouts

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The registry's agent 0.0.26 and ollama 0.0.20 hold other bytes than the judge-bearing checkouts.
- **Fix:** Bumped and published: agent 0.0.27 (gitHead 6ea0451), ollama 0.0.21, scaffold 0.0.95.
- **Files:** `commit 6ea0451 (agent)`.

### I-061 Stop hook asked to amend a published ollama merge commit

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The hook flagged merge commit 35e4b3a as Unverified and asked to change its author, but the remote branch points at it and the author is the identity the user named.
- **Fix:** Refused, because amending rewrites published history.
- **Files:** `commit 35e4b3a (ollama)`.

## Records and process

### I-062 Ollama checkout was on main

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The ollama checkout was on main, not the working branch.
- **Fix:** Created claude/confident-maxwell-6nd0f3 at HEAD and reset local main to origin/main.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-063 src/core line counts wrong in the context ruling

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The probe's trailing-newline handling gave src/core 7,807 lines and tests/src/core 13,406.
- **Fix:** Corrected to 7,781 and 13,383 in the falsification fold.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/context.md`, `commit 8772db7 (scaffold)`.

### I-064 Falsification of the context recommendation

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** 19 refuters attacked 15 claims: 4 held, 14 were amended, and claim 5 was refuted (it counted 18 ProviderInterface imports in agent.md as external and placed the relay in the browser guide).
- **Fix:** The amendments were folded into the record and claim 5 dropped; the record rests on ollama as the one runtime engine consumer.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/context.md`, `commit 8772db7 (scaffold)`.

### I-065 Unpinned-behavior count wrong

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The record first counted twelve unpinned behaviors.
- **Fix:** Corrected to eleven after the falsification round.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/context.md`.

### I-066 Scaffold guide mirror lags the agent checkout

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The objective lane's false clause 10 came from scaffold guides/agent.md:988 lagging agent commit 65c706a, not from an agent defect.
- **Fix:** None yet. The mirror refreshes in plan unit 14 (`re-pins and mirrors`), which waits on the agent release; no 0.0.30 release has been cut.
- **Files:** `scaffold:guides/agent.md:988`, `commit 65c706a (agent)`, `agent:guides/agent.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:104`.

### I-067 Record used banned writing-rule words

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The record used now, new, above, here, and temporal once.
- **Fix:** Each was replaced with a permitted phrase.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/context.md`.

### I-068 String replace expanded $` into duplicated text

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** String.prototype.replace interpreted $` in the replacement text and duplicated record text.
- **Fix:** The record was restored from git and edits use function replacements.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-069 Sweep deleted tmp/codex

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The sweep deleted tmp/codex, which launches write into.
- **Fix:** Recreate tmp/codex before launching.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-070 Python replace_line matched two bullets

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A Python replace_line edit matched two 'Handler home' bullets.
- **Fix:** Replacements are bounded to their own section.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-071 Sweep cut framing and carve paragraphs from the context record

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Replacing the plan table with a pointer also cut the framing rationale, the carve layout table, and the guide-scope ruling.
- **Fix:** Restored verbatim under their own heading.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/context.md`, `commit 180d667 (scaffold)`, `commit 03f0118 (scaffold)`.

### I-072 Records contradicted each other on release, order, and handler home

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** refine.md, context.md, and the 2026-10-05 records disagreed on the release number, the unit order, the selection handler home, the role registry, and sync versus async build (context.md:134). Seven 2026-10-05 records each spanned several packages or had landed as code.
- **Fix:** plan.md is the one home for order and status; the rulings resolve each contradiction, release.md gained the 0.0.27 row, and the seven records were deleted.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/release.md`, `commit 4fc091a (scaffold)`.

### I-073 Context ruling citations drift after code moves

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The judge and scope-dispatch commits moved lines, so older line citations in context.md and refine.md drift.
- **Fix:** Citations resolve by symbol, and the amended text is in both records.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/context.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md`.

### I-074 Desk re-pin waited on the other session's publishes

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The desk re-pin to published packages was blocked until the other session's ollama and scaffold publishes were done.
- **Fix:** Re-pinned to agent ^0.0.28 and ollama ^0.0.21 with the same gate counts.
- **Files:** `commit e9d6ca8 (desk)`.

### I-075 Fleet wave collides with the campaign release

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The other session published agent 0.0.29 from main (2c38d00) with no campaign commit, so the campaign ships as 0.0.30. Its release note must name the keep and rollup behavior changes, and agent main waits for the user's call.
- **Fix:** None yet. The branch merged agent main at 18f83c2 and again at 982fe5d, but the campaign release (0.0.30) is not cut and its behavior-change note waits on the user.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`, `commit 2c38d00 (agent)`, `commit 18f83c2 (agent)`, `agent:package.json:3`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/release.md:114`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/release.md:123`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:102`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:196`, `commit 982fe5d (agent)`.

### I-076 Possible duplicate session on the RelayStream fix

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The task card that started this session may have spawned a second session on the same fix.
- **Fix:** None. Nothing on this host shows whether a second session on the RelayStream fix exists or was stopped.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/t5-thinking-fix-last.md:12`.

### I-077 Comment-only units consumed passes

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Comment-only hygiene units spent passes on prose while implementation was pending.
- **Fix:** User ruling: implementation first; later units fix comments in the files they rewrite.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`, `commit dca8c26 (scaffold)`.

### I-078 Stale ollama-pin risk row

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The plan carried a stale ollama-pin risk row after the ollama release.
- **Fix:** The row was replaced and cleared items left the user's open list.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md`, `commit b5007fc (scaffold)`.

### I-079 Risks missing from the System One round

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The risks table lacked the numeric-spelling limit, registry versions that hold other bytes, the desk's pre-campaign browser failures, and the desk setup proof blocked on app:vue.
- **Fix:** All four have rows in the refine.md risks table. The risks themselves stay open: the desk keeps its fixtures in tests/app/fixtures.ts and has no tests/setup.test.ts.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md`, `commit f599f1e (scaffold)`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/refine.md:591-594`, `desk:tests/app/fixtures.ts`.

### I-080 Selection invariant stated without its conditions

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The plan stated the selection equality invariant without its conditions.
- **Fix:** Qualified: equality holds with scope and registry unchanged and the provider's replies fixed.
- **Files:** `commit 1690bad (scaffold)`.

### I-081 Guide unit left one out-of-scope patch

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The guide unit reported one small item outside its scope and left it as a patch; the source does not name it.
- **Fix:** None yet. The guide unit's out-of-scope patch is the `@returns` line of `AgentContextInterface.build`, which leaves out the selection's briefing. It and the unit's three TSDoc patches are all still unapplied.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/contexts/types.ts:644`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/constants.ts:135`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/factories.ts:6`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/Ledger.ts:67`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/u7-report.md:56-61`.

### I-082 Mica probe transcript swept

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The Mica probe transcript was swept on 2026-10-07 and cannot be recovered, so row 8's acceptance cannot read the probe.
- **Fix:** The selection fixtures carry a labelled stand-in of its shape, and acceptance reads the stand-in's applicability.
- **Files:** `commit bd8ca63 (scaffold)`.

### I-083 Moved to thinking and the 4B before settling the 2B

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The Orchestrator scheduled thinking mode and the 4B model before the user directed it.
- **Fix:** The user corrected it; both switches default to off until the user says otherwise.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-084 Briefing ledger naming confusion

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The user asked which design the briefing ledger was and whether it was the event-sourced idea.
- **Fix:** Defined as the event-sourced design: append-only stores, pin lifetimes, per-request projection, judge filing.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/BRIEFING.md`.

### I-085 Artifact page cluttered

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The user said the artifact page held too much content and comment clutter.
- **Fix:** None confirmed. The final page update is still pending, and the clutter complaint is about a rendered surface, which I cannot judge without a capture (NOT-EVIDENCED).
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/lab/context-lab.html`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/lab/context-lab.v20.html`.

### I-086 Fix-run-discover loop without clear progress

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Work ran one copy at a time and kept opening side investigations, and the user said runs were too long with no visible progress.
- **Fix:** The harness was frozen, a fixed 8-copy series set a verdict per design, probes between series runs were banned, and arms narrowed to records, full view, and compaction.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-087 Commit trailer names a model against the no-model-id rule

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The standing commit trailer names Claude Opus 5.5 while the same constraints ban model identifiers in repository artifacts.
- **Fix:** Ruled 2026-10-09: the trailer is the attribution line the session's commit instructions name verbatim, and it carries the product name, not a model identifier such as `claude-opus-5-5`, so commits keep it.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.claude/AGENTS.md:16`, `commit 4852d4c (agent)`.

### I-088 orchestration.md deletes .orkestrel at acceptance

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The campaign rule deletes .orkestrel/ in the acceptance commit, which conflicts with the user's instruction to keep the method explainer, ideas.md, and rejected.md.
- **Fix:** The user's instruction overrides the rule for those files, and the final notes call out the exception.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.agents/orchestration.md:116`.

### I-089 rejected.md correction left uncommitted

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The scaffold rejected.md correction stayed uncommitted while the stop hook asked for commits.
- **Fix:** Committed with the thinking-cap and answer-pass entries.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/rejected.md`, `commit b85a7c0 (scaffold)`.

### I-090 Ideas catalog missed 30 ideas

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Seven harvest lanes found 341 raw ideas, and the completeness critic found 30 more the first catalog missed.
- **Fix:** Deduplicated, checked against citations, and the 30 added.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/harvest/ideas.json`.

### I-091 Fleet name collisions

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Evidence belongs to rater, SearchOptions and SearchMatch to workspace, SelectionManagerInterface to table, Lookup to scaffold, Briefing to brief, and renderRecord to csv, while the port exports renderRecord. A memory entity would read as a Memory* store tier.
- **Fix:** The port gives every ledger export a `Ledger` prefix or a distinct name: renderLedgerRecord instead of renderRecord, and LedgerLookup instead of Lookup. It exports none of the colliding names and no Memory* ledger entity.
- **Files:** `agent:src/core/ledgers/helpers.ts:452`, `agent:src/core/ledgers/types.ts:170`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/units/port/u6-review-contract.md:59-62`.

### I-092 Grok bench not probed

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** No Cursor (Grok) lane ran in the 2026-10-09 dispatches, so the Grok bench reading is blank.
- **Fix:** None recorded. No Cursor (Grok) bench probe has run.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ledger.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ledger.md:10`.

### I-093 Cut-call count in FINAL-CHECK.md wrong

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** FINAL-CHECK.md recorded 1 of 19 calls cut at the thinking cap, but the log shows 2 of 22.
- **Fix:** Corrected at FINAL-CHECK.md:24.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/results/v10/FINAL-CHECK.md:24`.

## Environment

### I-001 Codex bench dark until device login completed

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** The Codex (Astra) bench was dark at the start of the campaign, so Opus held both design lanes. The first device-login code expired before the user finished the flow.
- **Fix:** A second login link and code were minted and the user completed the flow. The bench probe returned READY in 10 s on gpt-6-astra.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-002 GitHub Internal Server Error on desk pushes

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Pushes to desk returned HTTP 500; commit c9d39a1 was refused five times.
- **Fix:** Retried with backoff until ls-remote matched HEAD; it landed on the sixth attempt. The user confirmed a GitHub-side outage.
- **Files:** `commit c9d39a1 (desk)`.

### I-003 Desk devEngines refuses host npm 10.9.4

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Desk devEngines requires npm 11.6 or later, the host has npm 10.9.4, and npm ci and npm run check fail with EBADDEVENGINES. A login shell selects npm 10, and npx npm@11 is refused inside the desk.
- **Fix:** Desk commands run through a cached npm 11 placed first on PATH, from non-login shells. The scaffold bridge names scripts/npm.sh for this case.
- **Files:** `desk:package.json`.

### I-004 npm login link and one-time code expire quickly

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The npm login URL expires unclicked in about 45 s and a one-time code lives about 1 min.
- **Fix:** The login and OTP steps run through the publish skill script, and the upload runs right after the code is sent.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.agents/skills/orkestrel-publish/scripts/window.ts`.

### I-005 Background tasks capped at 2 h

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Background Bash jobs stop at a 2 h cap, near the length of the longer runs (both arm 1h48m). The Ollama daemon task hit the cap and stopped.
- **Fix:** Long runs use a detached nohup setsid runner with .done markers and watcher jobs, and the daemon was restarted with a fresh cap.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-006 Codex sandbox denies loopback bind

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** Astra's sandbox cannot listen on 127.0.0.1 (listen EPERM), so three listener cases of npm run test:guides fail inside codex. The first judgments writing launch stopped before any edit.
- **Fix:** Briefs name those cases as the sandbox's, and the Orchestrator runs test:guides outside the sandbox.
- **Files:** `agent:tests/guides.test.ts`.

### I-007 Astra sandbox EROFS through a symlinked node_modules

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Vite's temp write hit EROFS through the worktree's node_modules symlink, so Astra could not run Vitest and Port U4 type fixes moved to Sonnet.
- **Fix:** The port worktree's node_modules is a real directory of links, and U6 ran Vitest inside the sandbox.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-008 Read-only sandbox refused the Astra review report file

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The Astra review ran in a read-only sandbox and could not write its report file.
- **Fix:** The review was rerun with its report in the final message.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-009 Desk unit sandbox could not open browser and config gates

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The desk unit's sandbox could not open the browser and config gates.
- **Fix:** Those gates ran on the host.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-010 Implementer permissions refused two desk deletions

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The implementer could not delete the emptied desk policies source file and its old test.
- **Fix:** The Orchestrator checked that the cases were copied into the helpers test, deleted both files, and ran every gate.
- **Files:** `desk:tests/app/core/helpers.test.ts`.

### I-011 Toolbox repository not in session scope

- **Status:** open.
- **Issue:** The toolbox recall unit was planned beside the agent units, but the toolbox checkout is not in this session's scope.
- **Fix:** None yet. No toolbox checkout exists on this host, so the toolbox recall unit (plan unit 10) has not been built.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:100`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/plan.md:101`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/ideas.md:632-636`.

### I-012 Stale Vite pre-bundle after desk install

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** A Vite pre-bundle stayed stale after the desk install.
- **Fix:** The pre-bundle was cleared after the install.
- **Files:** `commit e9d6ca8 (desk)`.

### I-013 Artifact page comment buttons could not be tested

- **Status:** worked around.
- **Issue:** The page's Comment buttons appear only when the page opens in claude.ai, so the agent session could not test them.
- **Fix:** The comment feature was removed when the page was rebuilt.
- **Files:** none recorded.

### I-014 Gitignored tmp/ instruments are lost with the container

- **Status:** fixed.
- **Issue:** Bench harnesses, results, unit briefs, and the small-model instruments lived in gitignored tmp/ folders, which the container loses and other checkouts cannot reach.
- **Fix:** They are copied into the scaffold record under .orkestrel/agent/instruments with the same layout.
- **Files:** `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/instruments/bench/README.md`, `scaffold:.orkestrel/agent/small-models.md`, `commit b8e180b (scaffold)`.
