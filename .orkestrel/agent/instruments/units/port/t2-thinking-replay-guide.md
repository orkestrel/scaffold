An agent is a conversation with a model and the loop that carries it forward. A `Conversation` holds the history — a live tail of immutable messages plus the sections older turns were compacted into. An `AgentContext` assembles that history into the next prompt, folding in the instructions and the active workspace and applying the active scope. An `Agent` drives that prompt through a provider, dispatches requested tools admitted by scope and authority, feeds the results back, and repeats until the model stops. A `Ledger` composes all three to serve one conversation through a briefing projected from what a judge filed. Everything else in this module either configures those nouns or observes them. Source: [`src/core`](../src/core). Published through `@orkestrel/agent`.

Hand a provider a conversation and get back one assembled `ProviderResult` (`generate`), or a live stream of channel-tagged `ProviderDelta`s that returns that same assembled result when it ends (`stream`). Reasoning separation, the authority gate, and durable jobs sit around that boundary. The model itself is the one thing this package does not supply. `ProviderInterface` stays the boundary any backend can satisfy, and `AgentProvider` is the host-independent HTTP engine a concrete provider extends rather than rewrites: it owns the deadline, the transport, the bounded error read, the framing loop, reasoning separation, and result assembly, and the subclass fills in one vendor's wire. `RelayProvider` and `createRelay` carry that same boundary across your own server, so a browser drives a model it holds no credential for. There is no hidden global state, a plugin lifecycle, a prompt-template DSL, or an implicit memory store. This is a kit of composable primitives: the loop is the convenient way to use them, not the only one, and a caller that would rather bound and drive a provider by hand can skip it entirely.

Tools and files are borrowed, not owned. Callable tools come from [`@orkestrel/tool`](tool.md): the loop advertises their definitions to the model, dispatches the calls that come back, and feeds each `ToolResult` in as a tool message. A tool is loop machinery — it is never rendered into the prompt. Documents come from [`@orkestrel/workspace`](workspace.md): the context renders the active workspace into every turn, split by carrier — text as fenced reference blocks in the system message, images attached to the last user turn. That split is this package's own product policy, decided here because only the prompt-assembly layer knows what a turn looks like.

A turn has cancellation and iteration bounds. The run's `AbortSignal` folds an agent abort, a stream abort, an external signal, a [timeout](timeout.md), and the [budget](budget.md) through `AbortSignal.any` and bounds the provider. A handler's `context.signal` is that same signal. The budget is charged during provider streaming and between turns, before tool dispatch; exhaustion ends the run without dispatching, never inside a handler. Tool iteration is capped at `limit`. A running tool must cooperate with cancellation: the loop awaits its result even when it ignores the signal. A cancel commits a partial `AgentResult` that resolves after the running work settles. `generate` and `stream` share one private run, so their results agree, and the emitter isolates a listener's throw.

The loop and its tool handlers execute in the host that constructs them. See [Placement proofs](#placement-proofs) for the receipts distinguishing a Node process, a browser page, and a page that relays inference to Node.

## Surface

The agent-owned surface: the inference boundary and the HTTP engine behind it, the relay that carries that boundary to a browser, the judge boundary with its HTTP engine and the System One wire, the conversation layer, the context and its managers, the loop, the authority gate, the durable-job bridge, and the ledger that serves a conversation through a judge's filing. Tool and workspace entities belong to their originating packages and are consumed directly — never re-exported here — and one vendor's wire belongs to the concrete provider that extends `AgentProvider`.

A provider turns a conversation (plus optional tools) into a turn: `generate` resolves the assembled `ProviderResult` (content + any tool calls + any usage); `stream` yields channel-tagged `ProviderDelta`s as they arrive (`content` for answer text, `thinking` for live reasoning) and returns the same assembled result when the stream completes, so a caller can render tokens / reasoning live and still get the full outcome. Both bound the call with an `AbortSignal`:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAbort } from '@orkestrel/abort'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface // any concrete implementation supplied by the host app
const abort = createAbort()
const messages = [{ id: '1', role: 'user', content: 'Say hello.' }] as const

const result = await provider.generate(messages, abort.signal)
result.content // the assembled content
result.usage // { prompt, completion, total } — folds into a token budget

const generator = provider.stream(messages, abort.signal)
let step = await generator.next()
while (!step.done) {
	if (step.value.channel === 'content') process.stdout.write(step.value.text)
	if (step.value.channel === 'thinking') process.stderr.write(step.value.text)
	step = await generator.next()
}
const streamed = step.value // the assembled ProviderResult (content === the joined content deltas)
```

Pass `tools` (a non-empty `ToolDefinition[]`) to advertise callable tools for the turn; when the model calls one, `result.tools` is a `ToolCall[]` (each with an `id`, the tool `name`, and parsed `arguments`). Aborting a `stream` mid-flight throws a `ProviderAbortError` whose `partial` holds whatever streamed before the cancel.

A tool is a JSON-Schema-described callable from the [`@orkestrel/tool` package](tool.md). The registry's `definitions()` method advertises tools, and its `execute` method dispatches calls. When a turn advertises tools, the loop refuses a name excluded by the scope's tool allow-list before reaching the registry, with the scope denial. Without a tool allow-list, an unadvertised name passes through the authority gate and reaches the registry's `tool not found` failure if authority admits it. A name included in the allow-list also reaches the registry if authority admits it, even if unregistered. The returned `ToolResult` value uses the `success` discriminant: an unknown name and a throwing handler produce the failure arm, and batch execution isolates each call from its siblings. Direct registry calls behave as follows:

```ts
import { createTool, createToolManager } from '@orkestrel/tool'

const tools = createToolManager()
tools.add([
	createTool({
		name: 'add',
		description: 'Add two numbers',
		parameters: { type: 'object', properties: { a: { type: 'number' }, b: { type: 'number' } } },
		execute: (args) => Number(args.a) + Number(args.b), // narrow the model-supplied unknown
	}),
	createTool({ name: 'now', execute: () => Date.now() }),
])

const definitions = tools.definitions() // hand these to provider.generate / .stream as `tools`
const results = await tools.execute([
	{ id: '1', name: 'add', arguments: { a: 2, b: 3 } }, // → { success: true, id: '1', name: 'add', value: 5 }
	{ id: '2', name: 'ghost', arguments: {} }, // → { success: false, id: '2', name: 'ghost', error: 'tool not found: ghost' }
])
```

Contained failure is the registry's contract, not a limitation of it: in-process code that wants a typed error calls the tool itself — `tools.tool(name)` then `tool.execute(args, context)` inside its own `try`/`catch`. Registration, advertising, dispatch, and error containment are documented in [`tool.md`](tool.md).

Collect a turn's conversation in an `AgentContext`. Add turns through `context.messages` — the active conversation's live tail, always present, satisfying `MessageManagerInterface` by minting each `id` on `add` and keeping stored messages immutable and in insertion order — then `build()` the provider input: `[systemMessage?, ...messages]`. `context.tools` sits beside them, but it is a different kind of thing: the other managers assemble prompt text, while the tool registry exists so the loop can advertise definitions and dispatch calls. Its contents reach the model as the `tools` argument, never as a message:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAgentContext } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAbort } from '@orkestrel/abort'
import { createToolManager } from '@orkestrel/tool'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface
const abort = createAbort()
const context = createAgentContext({ system: 'You are concise.', tools: createToolManager() })
context.messages.add([
	{ role: 'user', content: 'What is 2 + 3?' }, // the `id` is minted by add, not supplied
	{ role: 'user', content: 'Reply with just the number.' },
])

const input = context.build() // [{ role: 'system', content: 'You are concise.' }, …the two user turns]
const definitions = context.tools.definitions() // tools reach the provider here, NOT in `input`
const result = await provider.generate(input, abort.signal, definitions)
```

`context.messages.add` mints each message's `id` (a random UUID) and returns the created message(s); `build()` is computed fresh on every call, so it always reflects the current conversation. Without a system prompt, `build()` is only the conversation, and no tool's name, description, or parameter schema ever appears in its output.

Drive the whole turn with an `Agent` (`createAgent`) — it composes the provider, its `AgentContext`, and the tool registry into the bounded context → provider → tools → repeat loop. Seed the conversation through `agent.context.messages`, then either `generate()` for a one-shot `AgentResult` or `stream()` for a live `AgentChunk` stream (`token` answer deltas, `think` reasoning deltas, `tool` dispatches, `usage`) whose `result` resolves the same `AgentResult`. `generate` drains that same stream, so they can't diverge:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAgent } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createTokenBudget } from '@orkestrel/budget'
import { createTool, createToolManager } from '@orkestrel/tool'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface
const tools = createToolManager()
tools.add(createTool({ name: 'add', execute: (args) => Number(args.a) + Number(args.b) }))

const agent = createAgent(provider, {
	system: 'You are concise.',
	tools,
	limit: 4, // cap tool iterations
	timeout: 30_000, // wall-clock deadline for the whole turn
	budget: createTokenBudget({ max: 50_000, scope: 'total' }), // cost ceiling
})
agent.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Use the add tool to add 2 and 3.' })

const stream = agent.stream()
for await (const chunk of stream.events) {
	if (chunk.category === 'token') process.stdout.write(chunk.content) // live deltas
	if (chunk.category === 'think') process.stderr.write(chunk.content) // live reasoning
	if (chunk.category === 'tool') log(chunk.call, chunk.result) // a dispatched tool + its result
}
const result = await stream.result // { content, usage?, partial } — usage summed across the turn
```

Both `generate` and `stream` accept optional per-run `AgentRunOptions` — `think` and `schema` (forwarded to the provider as `ProviderStreamOptions`) plus `limit` / `timeout` / `budget` / `signal`, each overriding its `AgentOptions` construction default for this run only. Omitting one keeps the constructed default, so a caller that passes no options gets the agent it configured. A per-run `signal` composes with (never replaces) a constructed `signal` — either aborting cancels the run; a per-run `budget` is `start()`ed for that run and is the one the loop charges, leaving a constructed `budget` untouched:

```ts
const agent = createAgent(provider, { tools, limit: 10, timeout: 60_000 }) // construction defaults
agent.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Summarize this doc.' })

// A tighter, structured-output run -- overrides limit + timeout, adds a schema, for THIS call only.
const result = await agent.generate({
	limit: 2,
	timeout: 5_000,
	schema: { type: 'object', properties: { summary: { type: 'string' } } },
})
```

`schema`, like `think`, rides into `provider.stream` as a `ProviderStreamOptions`: the loop composes both into one options object, omitting whichever key is unset, and passes no options object at all when neither is present — a provider that never received one still never does.

The turn is bounded by one cancel folded from the external `signal` + the `timeout` deadline + the `budget` signal through `AbortSignal.any`; `agent.abort(reason)` (or `stream.abort(reason)`) fires it. A cancel — external, deadline, budget, or `abort()` — commits a partial result: the `result` promise resolves with `{ partial: true, content: <what accumulated> }`, never rejects (a cancel is not an error); only a genuine provider / tool error rejects. An optional `scheduler.yield`s between turns; tool iteration is capped at `limit` (default `DEFAULT_AGENT_LIMIT`). Exhausting `limit` while the model still holds unresolved tool intent (it requested tools on the very last allowed turn) is a distinct, non-cancel cause of `partial: true` — it fires an `exhaust` event (the turns reached) instead of `abort`. A natural finish on the last allowed turn, or `limit: 0` (which never enters the loop), stays `partial: false`. `agent.status` transitions `idle` → `running` → `done` / `error`.

Gate the model's tool calls with an optional `Authority` (`createAuthority`) — a synchronous policy gate the loop consults after scope admits a call, passed through `AgentOptions.authority`. It walks ordered `rules` first-match-wins (a matched rule allows unless its `allowed` is `false`), falling back to a configurable default when none match — allow-unmatched by default (a denylist), or deny-by-default when its `fallback` denies (an allowlist). A denied call is never executed: the loop synthesizes the failure arm of `ToolResult` (`error: 'denied: <reason>'`) and feeds it back as a `tool` chunk and a tool message, so no handler runs, no budget is spent, and the model still sees what happened and can choose something else. An allowed call dispatches normally, and with no `authority` set every scope-admitted call dispatches:

```ts
import { createAgent, createAuthority } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createTool, createToolManager } from '@orkestrel/tool'

const tools = createToolManager()
tools.add([
	createTool({ name: 'add', execute: (args) => Number(args.a) + Number(args.b) }),
	createTool({ name: 'delete', execute: (args) => drop(args.id) }),
])

// A denylist: deny `delete`, allow everything else (the default allow fallback).
const authority = createAuthority({
	rules: [
		{
			match: (c) => c.call.name === 'delete',
			zone: 'restricted',
			allowed: false,
			reason: 'read-only mode',
		},
	],
})
const agent = createAgent(provider, { tools, authority })
agent.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Delete record 42.' })
// When the model calls `delete`, the loop feeds back { error: 'denied: read-only mode' } — never runs it.
```

Alongside the conversation store sits the standalone `InstructionManager` a richer context assembles a prompt from — named directives, keyed by `name`, listed by descending `priority`. It mirrors the registry shape — `add` (one or a batch) mints each `id` and overwrites a same-key entry (last write wins), an `instruction(name)` / `instructions()` accessor pair, `remove` (one or a batch) / `clear` / `count` — holds immutable entries, and is observable (`emitter` with an `add` / `remove` / `clear` event map, wired through the reserved `on` option; an `error` option receives a listener's throw). It carries the **build-contract** members a context's assembly step calls: `open` (the section header text, `'## Instructions'`) and `render(instruction)` (per-item rendering — the instruction's `content`):

```ts
import { createInstructionManager } from '@orkestrel/agent'

const instructions = createInstructionManager()
const safety = instructions.add({
	name: 'safety',
	content: 'Refuse unsafe requests.',
	priority: 10,
})
instructions.open // '## Instructions'
instructions.render(safety) // 'Refuse unsafe requests.'
```

Documents reach a turn one way only: through the active workspace. A [`@orkestrel/workspace`](workspace.md) workspace is a flat map of immutable files, and it takes no position on prompts — deciding how a file becomes part of a turn is this package's job, and the decision is a split by carrier. A text file renders as a fenced reference block in a `## Workspace` system section, where the model can read it as quoted material. An image file cannot be text, so its `base64` payload attaches to the last user message instead, which is where a vision model looks. A message carries that payload on its optional `images` field — `Message` and `MessageInput` both accept `readonly images?: readonly string[]` — and a vision-capable provider forwards it onto the wire (an empty or absent array is never sent). It is input-only; `ProviderResult` is unchanged.

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface // a vision-capable model
const result = await provider.generate(
	[{ id: '1', role: 'user', content: 'Describe this image.', images: ['<payload>'] }],
	abort.signal,
)
```

`AgentContext` wires the instruction manager and the workspace registry in. Beyond `system`, `messages`, and `tools`, a context exposes its own `instructions` manager and `workspaces` registry — pass pre-built ones through `AgentContextOptions`, or fresh empty ones are created — and `build()` folds them into the turn. The assembly order is one leading `system` message holding the system prompt, then the non-empty instructions block (its `description` header followed by every item's `format`), then the active workspace's text files under a `## Workspace` header, then the non-empty `briefing` member of a selection passed to `build` without a `fault`, joined by blank lines; then the conversation. With no instructions, no active workspace, and no scope, that reduces to exactly the lean `[systemMessage?, ...messages]`. The carrier split shows here: text rides the system block, image data rides the last user message.

````ts
import { createAgentContext } from '@orkestrel/agent'

const context = createAgentContext({ system: 'You are a code reviewer.' })
context.instructions.add({ name: 'tone', content: 'Be terse.', priority: 10 })
context.workspaces.add().write('src/main.ts', 'export const x = 1') // the active workspace
context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Review this.' })

const input = context.build()
// input[0] = { role: 'system', content:
//   'You are a code reviewer.\n\n## Instructions\n\nBe terse.\n\n## Workspace\n\nFile: src/main.ts\n```typescript\nexport const x = 1\n```' }
// input[1] = { role: 'user', content: 'Review this.' }
````

### Conversations & compaction

Above the flat `MessageManagerInterface` sits the `Conversation` (`createConversation` / a `ConversationManager`) — it owns its messages directly and compacts older ones into summarized `sections` so a long history fits a turn's context window without discarding the originals. Append turns through the conversation's own `add` (the live uncompacted tail; `message` / `messages` / `remove` / `clear` / `count` round it out); `compact()` folds the older live messages into a summarized `Section` (retaining their originals) and shrinks `view()` — the model input, where each section becomes one summary message followed by the live tail. Compaction is driven by a provider-agnostic `ConversationSummaryHandler` seam (`(messages) => Promise<string>`) the agent runtime supplies, so a `compact()` without one throws a `ConversationError`. With `rollup: true`, each compaction also regenerates the conversation rollup `summary`, a summary of every section summary, through a further summarizer call. Without it, no summarizer call is spent on a rollup and `summary` keeps its value: `undefined`, or the summary a restored snapshot carried. `keep` retains a recent tail (default `DEFAULT_CONVERSATION_KEEP` = `0`, no retained tail); `rehydrate(id)` / `search(query)` read the retained originals. A fold never takes the newest user message or any message after it, because that message is the request a run serves. An exchange is a user message and every message after it up to the next user message, and a message before the first user message belongs to the first exchange. A fold removes whole exchanges: a cut inside an exchange moves back to the user message that opens it. A fold never splits an assistant message with calls from the tool messages that answer it, matched by each tool message's `call` member with a positional fallback: a cut inside that group moves before the assistant message. When those rules leave nothing to fold, `compact()` returns `undefined`:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createConversation } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface // any concrete implementation supplied by the host app
// The summarizer seam — built from the provider by the runtime; core stays provider-agnostic.
// Append the instruction as the FINAL user turn: a chat model emits nothing when the prompt
// ends on an assistant turn, so a leading-system instruction is unreliable.
const conversation = createConversation({
	summarize: async (messages) =>
		(
			await provider.generate(
				[
					...messages,
					{ id: 's', role: 'user', content: 'Summarize the conversation so far concisely.' },
				],
				AbortSignal.timeout(30_000),
			)
		).content,
	keep: 2, // retain at least the two most recent messages verbatim on each compaction
	rollup: true, // also regenerate the rollup summary on each compaction
})
conversation.add([
	{ role: 'user', content: 'My name is Ada.' },
	{ role: 'assistant', content: 'Nice to meet you, Ada.' },
	{ role: 'user', content: 'Book a table for two at 19:00.' },
	{ role: 'assistant', content: 'Booked for two at 19:00.' },
	{ role: 'user', content: 'What did I say my name was?' },
])

const section = await conversation.compact() // folds the first exchange → a summarized section
conversation.view() // [<section summary message>, ...the retained recent exchanges] — the model input
conversation.summary // the regenerated rollup (a summary-of-summaries over all sections)
conversation.search('ada') // case-insensitive across sections' originals + the live tail
section && conversation.rehydrate(section.id) // the section's full original messages (a pure read)
```

Register a conversation in a `ConversationManager` and pass that registry through `AgentContextOptions.conversations` to make it the message source. `context.messages` then is the active conversation's live tail, and `build()` folds its `view()`. The scope's filters never touch messages; message inclusion is the conversation's through compaction and, when a handler is set, the selection's. When the registry is omitted, the context creates one with an active default conversation.

Pass that registry through `AgentOptions.conversations` together with an `AgentOptions.window` context [`Budget`](budget.md) to enable automatic compaction. Before the first provider request and between turns, the loop measures the working message array against the window and, when it reaches the ceiling, compacts the active summarizable conversation before continuing on the rebuilt view. Omit `window` and the loop does not auto-compact. See the [Contract](#contract) (the automatic-compaction clause) for the exact trigger and single-level limitation.

```ts
import { createAgent, createConversationManager, estimateMessages } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createBudget } from '@orkestrel/budget'

const conversations = createConversationManager({ summarize, keep: 2 })
const conversation = conversations.add()
const agent = createAgent(provider, {
	conversations,
	// A context Budget: consumer = a token estimator, max = the context window. The loop measures
	// the working message array against it; when that array reaches the window it compacts
	// + continues on the rebuilt (smaller) view (compact-and-continue), never aborts.
	window: createBudget({ max: 8_000, consumer: estimateMessages }),
})
agent.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Hi' })
await agent.generate() // folds older turns into a section mid-run when the prompt reaches the window, then continues
```

##### One agent, many conversations (switching the active conversation)

`agent.context.conversations` is the structural message-source registry — supplied at construction and never reassigned; switch its active conversation with `conversations.switch(id)` to switch the agent's message source. `context.messages` is dynamic: it always points at the current active conversation's live tail (the same reference, no duplication) and follows a switch. The registry always has an active conversation (a default is added when it has none). This is the real app pattern: one `Agent` over a `ConversationManager` of threads, switching the active conversation per request — not an agent per thread. Each conversation accumulates its own history and compacts independently (one thread's sections never leak into another). The agent reads `context.conversations` / `context.messages` fresh on each run, so switching between runs works:

```ts
import { createAgent, createConversationManager, estimateMessages } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createBudget } from '@orkestrel/budget'

const threads = createConversationManager({ summarize, keep: 2 }) // its defaults flow into each thread
const agent = createAgent(provider, {
	conversations: threads, // the agent's message source
	window: createBudget({ max: 8_000, consumer: estimateMessages }),
})

// Per request: make the request's thread active, append the user turn, run.
async function handle(threadId: string, text: string): Promise<string> {
	if (threads.conversation(threadId) === undefined) threads.add({ id: threadId })
	threads.switch(threadId) // SWITCH — context.messages IS this thread's tail from here
	agent.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: text })
	return (await agent.generate()).content
}

await handle('user-1', 'Hi, I am Ada.') // thread user-1 accumulates + compacts on its own
await handle('user-2', 'What is 2 + 2?') // thread user-2 is fully independent
await handle('user-1', 'What did I say my name was?') // back to user-1 — its own history is intact
```

> **Concurrency caveat.** Switch the active conversation between runs, never during one (the loop reads the active conversation at run entry and drives it through to the end). The framework ships the switch mechanism; the app owns concurrency policy — for threads that must run concurrently, use a separate `Agent` per concurrent thread (each agent is cheap; they can share the provider and tool registry). Switching mid-flight would repoint the live run's message source under it.

##### Production behaviors of automatic compaction

Auto-compaction (the `window` budget) is hardened for a long-running app:

- **Pre-first-turn + run-entry reset.** The budget check runs before the first provider request and between turns — so a resumed or already-long conversation whose initial prompt already exceeds the window compacts immediately (not only after a tool turn). The `window` budget is reset at run entry, so no stale measurement carries across runs or a conversation switch.
- **No fold after a cancel.** When the run's signal has aborted by the time tool dispatch ends, the loop records the tool messages and folds nothing, so a cancel never waits on the summarizer. The next run's pre-first-turn check folds the earlier exchanges, call groups whole.
- **Non-fatal, observable summarizer failure.** If the automatic `compact()`'s summarizer throws, the agent run does not crash: the loop skips compaction that turn, surfaces the error as a `fault` event (so the failure is observable, never silently lost), and continues (the over-window prompt proceeds to the provider). Only the agent's auto path is resilient — a manual `conversation.compact()` you call yourself still propagates its error.
- **Futile-compaction guard (the single-level limit).** If `compact()` folds nothing (returns `undefined`) while the prompt is still over the window — that is, the section summaries, the run's request, and the run's own turns, which a fold never takes, already exceed it — the loop stops auto-compacting for the rest of that run (a per-run latch), avoiding per-turn churn. The over-window prompt then proceeds to the provider, which surfaces a genuine context-length error if it truly cannot fit — the real limit. Compaction is single-level: it folds the live tail, never the existing sections.

```ts
agent.emitter.on('fault', (error) =>
	log('auto-compaction summarizer failed (run continues)', error),
)
```

### Scoping a turn

A `Scope` (`createScope` / a `ScopeManager`) is a named allow-list filter the context applies at `build()` time and at the loop's tool-advertise step. It carries an optional `instructions` / `tools` / `files` list keyed by each category's identity — `instructions` (by `name`), `tools` (by `name`), `files` (the active workspace's files, by `path`) — each three-way: `undefined` ⇒ no constraint (all pass), `[]` ⇒ none pass, a non-empty list ⇒ only the listed keys. The scope's filters never touch messages; message inclusion is the conversation's through compaction and, when a handler is set, the selection's, so a scope has no `messages` allow-list. A scope also carries an optional `select` handler, covered in [Selecting the messages a turn carries](#selecting-the-messages-a-turn-carries), and an optional `description` that `build()` never reads. Apply the active filter through `context.apply(scope)`; call `context.apply(undefined)` to remove filtering. The readonly `context.scope` getter reports the current filter, and `build()` reflects whatever scope is active when it runs (recomputed fresh each call). `narrow(config)` composes a tighter child scope by set-intersection (an `undefined` side imposes no constraint), so narrowing can only tighten — a parent-excluded key never returns:

```ts
import { createAgent, createScope } from '@orkestrel/agent'

const agent = createAgent(provider, { tools }) // tools holds `search` + `delete`
agent.context.instructions.add([
	{ name: 'safety', content: 'Refuse unsafe requests.' },
	{ name: 'verbose', content: 'Explain every step.' },
])
// This turn: only the `safety` instruction, and only the `search` tool.
agent.context.apply(
	createScope({
		name: 'read-only',
		instructions: ['safety'],
		tools: ['search'],
	}),
)
const result = await agent.generate()
```

A scoped-out tool is neither described nor callable. The loop snapshots the scope's tool allow-list before advertising and checks each returned call against that list before consulting the `AgentOptions.authority` option. An `undefined` scope value, or an absent `tools` list, admits every name, including an unknown name that the registry answers with its failure arm. An empty `tools` list admits none.

A scope change through the `context.apply` method applies at each later site that reads the scope. The tool half applies at the next turn's snapshot: a `tool` or `usage` listener changes the next turn's advertising, and a `turn` listener reaches the same turn, because `turn` fires before the snapshot. The prompt half (instructions, files, and `select`) applies at the next build or select site: run entry, the pre-first-turn compaction fold, or a compaction rebuild.

When no tool is advertised, including an empty registry, the provider's `content` field ends the run as the answer with a `partial: false` result. The assistant message is recorded without calls. Each dropped call emits a `deny` event with the `no tool is advertised in the active scope` reason, without a tool result or tool message.

When at least one tool is advertised, a call excluded by the tool allow-list emits a `deny` event with the `TOOL is not in the active scope` reason, where the `TOOL` placeholder is the requested name. Its denial `ToolResult` value carries the `denied: TOOL is not in the active scope` error and is fed back as a tool message. Admitted calls pass through authority and dispatch normally. The loop continues with results in the reply's call order, including when calls share an ID.

A `ScopeManager` registry stores reusable named scopes, keyed by a minted `id` field; scopes can share a `name` field. It is observable like the other managers.

### Selecting the messages a turn carries

A selection handler chooses the conversation messages the next prompt carries for one user request. It has two homes: `AgentOptions.select` is the agent default, forwarded as `AgentContextOptions.select`, and the active scope's `select` overrides it while that scope is active. The `context.select` method resolves `scope?.select ?? default` once per call and returns `undefined` when neither home holds a handler, so the default path awaits nothing before the first provider request.

The loop calls the handler at each select site (run entry, the pre-first-turn compaction fold, and a compaction rebuild) with the user message that ends the active conversation's view at run entry and the run's signal; when the view ends on another role, it calls no handler. It folds the result through `build(selection)`, which carries `selection.messages` in place of `view()` and appends a non-empty `selection.briefing` as the last part of the system message unless the selection has a `fault`, and then emits `select` with the `Selection`. That event fires at each select site, so twice before turn 0 when the pre-first-turn fold runs, and never for a run cancelled during selection.

A `Selection` carries the `messages`, the `judgments` keys they rest on, the judge `usage` spent, an optional `fault`, and an optional `briefing`, the text `build` appends as the last system part. It has no tool member: what a turn advertises and dispatches stays the scope's `tools` allow-list.

The following agent selects through its default handler, then through a mode's override:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface, Selection, SelectionHandler } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAgent, createScope } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface

// The agent default keeps the user turns; the focus mode keeps the request alone.
const userTurns: SelectionHandler = async (conversation) => ({
	messages: conversation.view().filter((message) => message.role === 'user'),
	judgments: [],
})
const requestOnly: SelectionHandler = async (_conversation, request) => ({
	messages: [request],
	judgments: [],
})

const agent = createAgent(provider, { system: 'You triage billing tickets.', select: userTurns })
const receipts: Selection[] = []
agent.emitter.on('select', (selection) => receipts.push(selection))
agent.context.messages.add([
	{ role: 'user', content: 'The invoice total is wrong.' },
	{ role: 'assistant', content: 'Which invoice?' },
	{ role: 'user', content: 'Invoice 42.' },
])
await agent.generate() // the provider reads the system block and the two user turns

agent.context.apply(createScope({ name: 'focus', select: requestOnly }))
agent.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Refund it.' })
await agent.generate() // the provider reads the system block and 'Refund it.'
receipts.map((selection) => selection.messages.length) // [2, 1]

const plain = createAgent(provider)
const request = plain.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Invoice 42.' })
plain.context.select(request, new AbortController().signal) // undefined — no handler in either home
```

A selection fails three ways. A handler throw emits `fault`, and the loop builds from `view()` with no `select` event. A returned `fault` charges its usage first, then emits `fault`, and the loop builds from the returned `messages` and emits `select`. A conversation changed under the handler is a fault as well: `context.select` returns the current `view()` with a `fault` that names the change. With `AgentOptions.strict` set, all three settle the run `error`. A cancel at a select site wins over all of them, and the run commits partial with no provider call.

Selection usage is charged in full to the cost `budget` and folded into `AgentResult.usage`. No `usage` chunk or `usage` event carries it, so that chunk keeps its one-provider-call meaning.

### Judgments on the conversation

A conversation's `judgments` store records what a judge answered about its messages. Each record is keyed by the caller's question id, and adding an existing key replaces the record in place, last write wins, at its original insertion position, and the `add` method stamps the `time` member. A record carries the question, the answer or the refusal, the judge's configured `model`, the ordered `sources` ids, and the rendered `state`, and it carries `usage` only when its request asked that one question.

The `resolve(judge, request, sources, signal)` method reuses every recorded judgment that matches and asks the judge once for the rest, recording what returns. A match compares the question's JSON text with its key order kept, the sources in order, the rendered state, and the judge's configured `model` rather than the name a server reports, so reordered criteria, a changed state, or a changed source asks again. A cancel keeps the records of the questions that completed and rethrows the abort.

A question id is a caller key the model never sees, so the whole question lives in `instructions`, and a judgment that needs an earlier answer is a second request. A snapshot carries `judgments` only while the store holds one, so a conversation without judgments serializes as `{ id, summary?, sections, messages }`, and a snapshot written without the member still validates and restores.

The following conversation records one answer and then reuses it:

```ts
import type { JudgeRequest } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createConversation, createSystemOneJudge } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const signal: AbortSignal

const judge = createSystemOneJudge({ url: 'http://localhost:11434', model: 'tev1:0.8b' })
const conversation = createConversation()
const ticket = conversation.add({
	role: 'user',
	content: 'Our checkout has returned 500 errors since 9am. I want a refund for today.',
})
const request: JudgeRequest = {
	state: ticket.content,
	questions: {
		refund: {
			form: 'noul',
			instructions: 'Does the customer ask for money back?',
			criteria: {
				true: 'The customer asks for a refund or for money back.',
				false: 'The customer does not ask for money back.',
			},
		},
	},
}

const [asked] = await conversation.judgments.resolve(judge, request, [ticket.id], signal)
asked?.model // 'tev1:0.8b' — the configured judge
asked?.usage // { prompt: 975, completion: 4, total: 979 } — the request asked this one question
const [reused] = await conversation.judgments.resolve(judge, request, [ticket.id], signal)
reused?.time === asked?.time // true — the matching record answers without a call
conversation.snapshot().judgments?.length // 1
```

The usage in the comment is the one the recorded Ollama response of 2026-10-07 reports; the executed transcription in [`tests/guides.test.ts`](../tests/guides.test.ts) serves that response from a loopback listener.

### The stock selection

The `createSelection({ judge, screen, needed, limit })` factory returns a `SelectionHandler` that asks a judge whether each screened message is needed for the request. The `screen` handler is the application's cheap pass and returns the message ids selection may ask about. The `needed` option is a `Criterion` holding the application's `yes` and `no` text and its `threshold`: the threshold is the application's and no default exists, and a cutoff outside the interval above 0.5 up to and including 1 throws `SelectionError` with code `THRESHOLD`. The `NEEDED_CRITERION` constant supplies the measured `yes` and `no` wordings without a threshold. The `limit` option bounds the fresh questions one selection asks, and a value that is not a nonnegative safe integer throws `SelectionError` with code `LIMIT`.

Each question is the fixed `NEEDED_QUESTION`, which asks whether message [A] is needed to carry out the request in message [B] correctly, over a state that renders the view with the subject marked [A] and the request marked [B]. The handler first removes the `needed` judgments keyed to an earlier request, then reuses each matching record and asks one question per remaining subject until `limit` fresh questions are spent.

A subject is dropped only when its recorded answer is a decisive no, at or under the complement of the threshold. The request is never dropped and never asked about. An unscreened, unasked, refused, limit-cut, or uncertain subject is kept, and the result is a subset of `view()` in view order.

Selection keeps whole exchanges. A user message and every message after it up to the next user message form one exchange, which is kept whole when any member is kept and dropped only when every member is dropped, so a kept call and its result never reach the model without the request they answered. An assistant message with calls and the tool messages that answer it, grouped by the `collectToolGroups` helper, are kept or dropped whole in the same way, and a group that spans two exchanges joins them.

A judge error for one subject leaves that subject undecided, so it is kept, and the handler asks about the next subject. When the judge fails for every subject asked and no recorded judgment is reused, the handler returns a `Selection` with `fault` set to an error whose cause is the first judge error, `messages` as `view()`, and no judgment keys, rather than throwing. A cancel returns `fault` with the cancel as its cause, `messages` as `view()`, the judgment keys recorded so far, and the usage spent.

The following selection keeps every message except the one the judge answered no for:

```ts
import type { ScreenHandler } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import {
	createConversation,
	createSelection,
	createSystemOneJudge,
	NEEDED_CRITERION,
} from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const threshold: number // the application's cutoff: above 0.5 and at most 1
declare const limit: number // the fresh questions one selection may ask
declare const signal: AbortSignal

const judge = createSystemOneJudge({ url: 'http://localhost:11434', model: 'tev1:0.8b' })
// The application's cheap pass: only user turns are candidates.
const screen: ScreenHandler = (conversation) =>
	conversation
		.view()
		.filter((message) => message.role === 'user')
		.map((message) => message.id)
const select = createSelection({ judge, screen, needed: { ...NEEDED_CRITERION, threshold }, limit })

const conversation = createConversation()
const [, , , , request] = conversation.add([
	{ role: 'user', content: 'Use only local files; do not access the internet.' },
	{ role: 'assistant', content: 'The export will read the local SQLite database.' },
	{ role: 'user', content: 'The office printer needs paper.' },
	{ role: 'user', content: 'Include a header row in exports.' },
	{ role: 'user', content: 'Export the active accounts from the local database.' },
])
const selection = await select(conversation, request, signal)
selection.messages.map((message) => message.content)
// [
//   'Use only local files; do not access the internet.',
//   'The export will read the local SQLite database.',
//   'Include a header row in exports.',
//   'Export the active accounts from the local database.',
// ] — the judge answered no for the printer note alone; the header row stays uncertain and is kept
selection.judgments.length // 3 — one recorded judgment per screened subject
```

The comments read the answers the executed transcription in [`tests/guides.test.ts`](../tests/guides.test.ts) serves from a loopback listener: probabilities taken from the recorded Ollama response of 2026-10-07, read at a cutoff the transcription supplies.

Treat a judge as frozen at inference: change thresholds and criteria in code, record corrections as judgments, and train another model only offline, as a batch on rows collected for that purpose, refitting temperature on rows the training run did not see.

Write criteria for a judge that reads literally (see [Jev 1.13 jaggedness](https://docs.typesafe.ai/model-jaggedness/jev-1.13.md)). Scoping words and negations count, so keep a `noul` whose true side means yes, and keep indirection such as a double negative out of the text. Keep arithmetic and date comparison in code, filter irrelevant state before asking, and treat a note inside the state as data that can move the answer. Reorder options to check for a lean toward the first one.

### Serving a conversation through a ledger

A ledger serves one conversation as an event-sourced briefing with per-owner records. The `createLedger(provider, options)` factory returns a `LedgerInterface` value that owns the conversation, the agent that answers it, and that agent's tools, and its `respond` method appends a request as a user message and serves it through to the reply. The conversation is the event log, and no request reads all of it. Each request reads a briefing that the ledger projects from what a judge filed about every message, then a tail of the seed history (the messages added before the first request), then the request. An earlier request and its reply never re-enter the prompt; what its lookups returned reaches a later request through the records and the `recall` tool.

The method has the following pieces, each named by its export:

- **The filing.** The `Classifier` class files each message through the judge the `judge` option injects; the measured series injected Mica. The ledger files a tool result, its own notes, an assistant call, and an assistant reply after the first request by their shape, and asks the judge about the rest: the `LEDGER_QUESTIONS` category question about each remaining message, the topic question, for each desk topic, about each request and each of those messages the category question doesn't file quiet; and the `amends` question about a later user message whose `correction` probability reaches the `correction` cutoff and an earlier message that isn't quiet and shares an id, an owner, or a desk topic with it, followed by the `supersedes` question about the same pair when the `amends` answer reaches its cutoff. Every answer lands in the conversation's `judgments` store, so a later request asks only what no earlier one asked, and the `LedgerClassification` value reads the filing back at the cutoffs.
- **The records.** The `buildRecords` helper projects the filing into one `LedgerRecord` value per owner a lookup result names, plus one rules record for the rules and corrections no owner claims. Each line is a verbatim sentence of a live message. A message filed quiet or superseded isn't live, and a sentence that shares an id or a number with a later message that amends it is stale: the projection lists it in its `stale` member and leaves it out of every record and every route to the model.
- **The plan.** For each request, the ledger selects the records the request names through the `selectRecords` helper and fits the briefing and the tail inside a token budget: the `capacity` option times the `prompt` share, less the fixed cost of the gauge and held back by the `LEDGER_SCALE_DRIFT` constant, of which the tail takes at most the `tail` share. The `share` option sets both shares, and the `DEFAULT_LEDGER_SHARE` constant holds the measured ones. Until the briefing fits, the ledger drops the rules off the request's topics, then the sources outside the selected records, then the rules on its topics, then the owner lines. The `Gauge` class prices the prompt; without the `gauge` option, the ledger calibrates before its first pass, and the `calibrate` method measures the price on demand. A lookup in the tail reaches the model as the stub the `renderStub` helper writes, which says whether the briefing shows its result. The plan reaches the agent as a `Selection` value: its `messages` member is the tail, and its `briefing` member is the text the `build` method appends as the last part of the system message.
- **The `recall` tool.** The ledger registers a `recall` tool beside the application's lookups. It returns the live lines that match a topic (an owner name, an id, or a desk topic), newest first, cut to the room the gauge leaves for the reply. A request can call it as many times as the `limit` member of the `recall` option allows, the `DEFAULT_RECALL_LIMIT` constant by default; after that, or when the capacity left falls under twice the reply's reserve, it returns the `closed` note.
- **The repeat stop.** A lookup or `recall` call that repeats an earlier call of the same request, compared by tool name and canonical arguments, returns the `repeat` note as its failure, and the ledger aborts the pass.
- **The answer pass.** When the first pass ends partial or without final text and the caller didn't abort, the ledger adds a note that carries what the pass's lookups and recalls returned, then the `cue` note, and runs one answer pass that advertises no tools. The `passes` member of the `LedgerResult` value holds both passes, and its `content` member is the last pass's.

The application supplies the following through `LedgerOptions`:

- the judge, through the `judge` option;
- the question wording, through the `questions` option, where the `LEDGER_QUESTIONS` constant is the measured wording, and its own cutoffs through the `thresholds` option, which has no default because a cutoff holds only for the wording and the judge it was fitted on;
- the desk topics, through the `topics` option;
- the lookups, through the `lookups` option, each a tool the model calls and a reading handler that names the ids and the owners in its result;
- the capacity, through the `capacity` option, the model's context window in tokens.

The method has the following documented limits:

- **The person prefix trusts capital letters.** A sentence that opens with a pronoun takes the last capitalized name of the sentence before it as its party, so a capitalized word that names no person, such as a carrier named mid-sentence, is read as the party.
- **A desk-wide correction stays in one owner's record.** A message that names an owner joins that owner's record and not the rules record, so a correction to a desk-wide rule stated inside one owner's message isn't among the rules a request about another owner reads.
- **Recall identity is the topic alone.** The repeat stop compares two `recall` calls by their trimmed `topic` argument, so a second call with the same topic is a repeat whatever other arguments it carries.
- **A seed tool message counts as successful.** A tool message the application adds to the conversation has no recorded result, so the ledger reads it as a successful lookup and files it as a fact, and its reading handler decides what the result names.
- **An abort during calibration rejects.** When the caller's signal aborts while the ledger calibrates, the `respond` method rejects with the abort reason instead of resolving a partial result; after calibration, an abort ends the request partial and skips the answer pass.

On a 48-message support-shift benchmark measured on 2026-10-09, with the 2B Qwen model (`qwen3.5:2b-q4_K_M` tag, thinking off) answering and the Mica judge (`hf.co/sky7350/Mica-v0.1-4B` tag) filing, over 8 reworded copies under a blind two-sided audit, the records design passed 6.50 to 6.75 of every 10 requests per copy, the refined briefing (the same briefing without the records) 5.63 to 6.13, and the full conversation view 4.38 to 5.13. The records design and the refined briefing each cleared the paired band against the full view, and the records design against the refined briefing stayed inside the noise. That reading describes that benchmark and those two models alone.

### Customizing the format (the cascade)

Each context section frames as `[open, ...items.map(render), close]` — a top line rendered once before the items, each item's text, and a bottom line rendered once after — with empty / absent slots dropped and the survivors blank-line (`\n\n`) joined. The instruction manager resolves each slot independently through a cascade, most-specific-first; each level is optional, what you omit falls through to the next, and omitting everything leaves each section on its manager's built-in framing — only the header and the items, with no closing line. From most to least specific:

1. **Item override** — `override?: string` on a single `InstructionInput`: a fully-rendered string for that item, round-tripped onto the stored entity. Beats every other level for that item's `render`.
2. **Manager-options override** — `format?: ContextSectionFormat<…>` on `InstructionManagerOptions` (an `{ open?; render?; close? }` trio): a per-section open / item-render / close override for that whole manager. Beats the built-in.
3. **Built-in** — the manager's `## Instructions` header and each item's content — the floor for `open` and `render`. There is no built-in `close`: an unset `close` yields no closing line.

The manager applies all three levels itself, so `context.build()` reads its `open`, `render(item)`, and `close` as given. For a manager whose options carry the format `O`: **open** = `O.open ?? '## Instructions'` (manager-options > built-in — the leading text has no per-item level); **per item** `I` = `I.override ?? O.render?.(I) ?? I.content` (item > manager-options > built-in); **close** = `O.close` (manager-options only, no built-in ⇒ no closing line when unset). `open`, the rendering, and `close` resolve independently, so an override can set only the open, only the rendering, only the close, or any mix — and `open` + `close` together wrap the whole group. (The `## Workspace` text section has no cascade level of its own — it renders with the fixed `renderFencedFile` framing.)

```ts
import { createAgentContext, createInstructionManager } from '@orkestrel/agent'

// Manager-options override — wrap the instructions as a closed XML group for this manager.
const instructions = createInstructionManager({
	format: {
		open: '<rules>',
		render: (one) => `<rule>${one.content}</rule>`,
		close: '</rules>',
	},
})
const context = createAgentContext({ instructions })
context.instructions.add({ name: 'tone', content: 'Be terse.' })
// An item override beats the manager `render` for THAT item only:
context.instructions.add({
	name: 'raw',
	content: 'ignored',
	override: '<rule priority="high">Escalate.</rule>',
})

context.build()
// system block instructions section (the group wrapped by open + close):
//   '<rules>\n\n<rule>Be terse.</rule>\n\n<rule priority="high">Escalate.</rule>\n\n</rules>'
```

When a provider's model has a framing preference, such as XML tags, install that framing as the manager-options `format` on the agent's instruction manager (`createAgent(provider, { instructions: createInstructionManager({ format }) })`). A provider carries no framing of its own, so the request it receives depends only on the agent's context.

### The HTTP provider engine

`ProviderInterface` is the boundary; `AgentProvider` is the engine behind it. Every HTTP-backed provider needs the same machinery — a deadline, a transport, an authorization hook, a bounded error read, a chunk decoder, reasoning separation, and result assembly — and rewriting that per vendor is how a fleet of providers drifts apart. `AgentProvider` owns all of it and leaves exactly one thing open: the wire. A subclass supplies `name` and the wire seams — `frame()` returns fresh framing state for the call, `body(request)` projects a `ProviderRequest` onto the vendor's request shape, `read(record)` decodes one framed record into a `ProviderIncrement`, and `finish(parser)` returns whatever the parser still held at end of input. The engine is generic over `TRecord`: the record type a call's `frame()` parser emits and `read` consumes, defaulting to `Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>` for a wire whose records are JSON objects. The constructor switches decide the rest: `split` separates in-content `<think>` reasoning from the answer (default `true`), and `strict` requires the wire to carry a settled `result` record rather than assembling one at end of input (default `false`).

```ts
import type { AgentProviderInput, ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAbort } from '@orkestrel/abort'

declare function createTextProvider(options: AgentProviderInput): ProviderInterface
declare function token(signal: AbortSignal): Promise<string>
const abort = createAbort()
const messages = [{ id: '1', role: 'user', content: 'Say hello.' }] as const

const provider = createTextProvider({
	url: 'https://api.example',
	path: '/generate', // appended to `url` on every call
	timeout: 30_000, // the base's own deadline; DEFAULT_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT when omitted
	headers: async (signal) => ({ authorization: await token(signal) }), // awaited inside that deadline
	split: true, // route <think> spans to `thinking`, yield the clean answer
	strict: false, // assemble at end of input instead of requiring a settled record
})
const result = await provider.generate(messages, abort.signal)
result.content // the assembled answer, with any <think> span routed to result.thinking
```

`AgentProvider` exposes a readonly `replay` policy from its constructor input. Default: `'none'`. `RelayProvider` inherits this member and forwards its `replay` option. The agent records each call's non-empty thinking on that call's assistant message, including tool-call messages and final answers; empty thinking is omitted. Before each provider call and compaction estimate, the agent applies `stripThinking`: `'none'` removes thinking, `'turn'` retains thinking after the last user message, and `'all'` retains it across user turns. A provider without a `replay` member uses `'none'`. `RelayStream` applies its upstream provider's policy again, so a relay chain retains only thinking both policies permit.

`AgentProvider` is `abstract`; the members a subclass fills are listed under [`## Methods`](#methods).

The engine's failures arrive as one error class. A `ProviderError` carries a machine-readable `code` and, for an HTTP failure alone, the response `status`; `isProviderError` narrows a caught value so a caller can branch on the code:

- `'HTTP'` — a non-OK response. The message is `provider error: <status>`, with ` - <excerpt>` appended only when the response body carried text. The excerpt is read to at most `MAX_ERROR_BODY_LENGTH` bytes and the remainder of the body is cancelled, so a stalled error body cannot hold the call open past its deadline.
- `'PROTOCOL'` — a successful response with no body, a wire record the concrete provider refuses, or a `strict` stream that ended without a settled result.
- `'PROVIDER'` — an upstream failure a relay reported in an `error` frame.

A cancel is not in that taxonomy: the call's own deadline and the caller's signal are folded into one bound, and a cancel throws `ProviderAbortError` carrying the partial assembled so far.

### The judge engine

The `JudgeInterface` contract is the decision boundary beside `ProviderInterface`, and it is never a provider. Its `ask(request, signal)` method answers typed questions about one state with a probability distribution per question. A `JudgeRequest` carries the `state` and the `questions` keyed by your own ids, which the model never sees; each question is a `ChoiceQuestion`, a `ScoreQuestion`, or a `NoulQuestion`, named by its `form` member. A `JudgeResult` carries the answering model in its `model` member, the `answers` map keyed by the same ids, the `refusals` map of the questions a wire refused, and the `usage` member with the tokens the calls spent. An answer stores only the distribution the server returned: `probabilities` for a choice or a score, and `noul`, the probability of yes, for a noul question. The `computeReading` function derives every measure from that distribution, so every server reads on one scale and no stored measure can drift from its distribution (the derived-reading clause).

The `AgentJudge` class is the engine behind that boundary, as the `AgentProvider` class is the engine behind `ProviderInterface`. It owns each call's deadline, the transport, the `headers` hook, the validation before inference, the bounded error read, and the merge of every call's result, and it leaves the wire open: a subclass supplies `name`, `body(request)`, which projects one call's `JudgeRequest` onto the protocol's request shape, and `read(value, request)`, which decodes one call's parsed response into a `JudgeResult`. A one-shot JSON response has no framing state and no buffered tail, so the engine has no `frame` or `finish` seam. In place of the `split` and `strict` switches it takes one `batch` switch: `true`, the default, sends every question in one call, and `false` sends one call per question in key order.

The `SystemOneJudge` class is the wire this package ships on that engine, and the `createSystemOneJudge` factory returns it behind `JudgeInterface`. It speaks the System One decision protocol at `SYSTEM_ONE_PATH` and sends every question in one call. See [Asking a System One server a choice, a noul, and a score](#asking-a-system-one-server-a-choice-a-noul-and-a-score) for the servers it serves and a whole request; see [Writing a judge wire](#writing-a-judge-wire) for a wire of your own.

The engine's failures arrive as one error class. A `JudgeError` carries a machine-readable `code` and, for an HTTP failure alone, the response `status`; the `isJudgeError` function narrows a caught value so a caller can branch on the code:

- `'QUESTION'` — a request refused before inference: an empty question map, a malformed question named by its id, a state that is not a `JudgeEntry`, or a request a wire's `body` method refuses. No call is made.
- `'HTTP'` — a non-OK response. The message is `judge error: <status>`, with ` - <excerpt>` appended only when the response body carried text, read to at most `MAX_ERROR_BODY_LENGTH` bytes.
- `'PROTOCOL'` — a successful response with no body or with a body that is not JSON, or a response the wire cannot read.

A cancel is not in that taxonomy: it throws `JudgeAbortError`, whose `partial` merges the calls that completed before the cancel, and the `isJudgeAbortError` function narrows a caught value to it (the abort-partial clause).

### The relay

In the page-to-Node placement, the page owns `Agent`, `RelayProvider`, and its tool registry. Node owns the `createRelay` handler and upstream provider. The hop carries inference requests and replies; a tool handler executes where its registry lives. The Chromium receipt is planned in the `@orkestrel/mcp` distribution proof named under [Placement proofs](#placement-proofs) and is not recorded here as passed.

A browser must not hold a model credential, so this package ships the hop rather than the credential. `createRelay` returns a `RelayHandler` — a plain `(request: Request) => Promise<Response>` you mount on any fetch-standard router — that authorizes the request, validates its JSON body against `providerRequestContract`, and streams one upstream `provider.stream` call back as newline-delimited `RelayFrame` records under `RELAY_CONTENT_TYPE`. `createRelayProvider` is the other end: a `ProviderInterface` the browser drives exactly like a local one, which posts the request and decodes those frames back into deltas and the settled result. `RelayStream` is the response half `createRelay` composes, exported for a host that mounts its own route.

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createRelay, createRelayProvider } from '@orkestrel/agent'
// The browser application supplies this parser dependency.
import { createNDJSONParser } from '@orkestrel/ndjson'

declare const upstream: ProviderInterface // the server-side provider holding the credential

// On the server: the route, the authorization decision, and the byte budget.
const handler = createRelay({
	provider: upstream,
	authorize: (request) => request.headers.get('authorization') === 'Bearer session-token',
	limit: 65_536, // a body at or above this answers 413
})

// In the browser: a provider like any other, reached over that route.
const browser = createRelayProvider({
	url: 'https://app.example/relay',
	parser: createNDJSONParser,
	headers: () => ({ authorization: 'Bearer session-token' }),
})
```

The frame vocabulary is `RelayFrame`: a `ProviderDelta` (`content` or `thinking`) per streamed delta, one `{ channel: 'result', result }` when the turn settles, `{ channel: 'abort', partial }` when the upstream call was cancelled, and `{ channel: 'error', message }` for anything else — always the fixed `RELAY_PROVIDER_MESSAGE` text, so an upstream failure's own message never reaches the browser. A refusal never becomes a frame: the handler answers `401` when `authorize` refuses or throws, `400` when the body is missing, unreadable, or rejected by the contract, `413` when the body reaches the byte limit, and `502` when the upstream call cannot be constructed. Each refusal carries no body and reaches the browser as a `ProviderError` with the `HTTP` code and that status.

The wire is strictly narrower than the domain on purpose. `providerRequestContract` and `relayFrameContract` are compiled from the shapes listed under [Providers module](#providers-module), and `RelayProvider.body` refuses a request the JSON wire cannot carry — a function-valued tool argument, a parameter schema holding one — before it fetches. The body it sends is an owned snapshot of that projection read through property descriptors, so a serializer reachable only through a `get` trap or a prototype is never consulted; an own function-valued property such as a `toJSON` method is a value outside JSON and is refused before fetching, with the clone's failure as the refusal's `cause`. A `ToolContext` stays with local execution; the call envelope carries only `id`, `name`, and `arguments`.

### Root module

The root holds the package's shared vocabulary: the message and judge value types, the role list, the judge abort error, the message and tool-call wire shapes with the message contract, and the helpers and guards that more than one module reads.

Each module section lists its exports by kind file, and a `Shape` cell reads by table. On a constant it holds the declared type. On a type it holds an interface's data members as bare names in braces, `?` marking an optional member and `plus` introducing its call-signature members, with an extended interface's name before `plus`, or a type alias's own type literal with a union's arms escaped as `\|`. On a shape it holds the projected record's members in the same notation, on a contract the domain type the contract narrows to, and on a guard the type the guard narrows to. Each guard reads an `unknown`, returns `false` off-shape, and never throws, and an error guard stays in its module's Errors table beside the error it narrows.

| `ScoreCriteria`  | type      | `readonly [JudgeEntry \| null, JudgeEntry \| null, ...Array<JudgeEntry \| null>]` | Lists at least two score levels from level 0 upward; null leaves a level undescribed.                                                                                                                                                         |

| `filterAllowList` | function | Filters a list of items by a `ScopeInterface` allow-list of keys — `undefined` passes everything, `[]` passes nothing, and a non-empty list passes the listed keys alone, order preserved. The pure, total set-membership primitive the context's build step and the agent loop's tool-advertise step apply a scope through. |
| `sanitizeToken`   | function | Sanitizes one reported token count into a safe non-negative integer — a non-finite or non-positive value becomes `0`, and a positive fractional value floors down.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `sanitizeUsage`   | function | Sanitizes a `TokenUsage` into safe, non-negative integers — the guard an agent's abort-usage path applies to a provider's partial usage before it is charged against a budget or folded into the run total.                                                                                                                  |
| `joinThinking`    | function | Joins the reasoning a run's provider calls separated from the answer — the first call seeds the accumulation, a later call appends blank-line separated so each turn's reasoning stays readable.                                                                                                                             |
| `sumUsage`        | function | Adds two `TokenUsage` values field by field — the running total an agent run keeps across its provider calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `removeEntries`   | function | Removes each key through a single-key remover and folds the outcomes, so a batch `remove` reports whether the whole batch applied.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `copyJSON`        | function | Owns a value by serializing it to JSON and parsing the text, so the copy shares nothing with its source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `isJudgeEntry`    | function | `JudgeEntry`    | Checks whether a value is a judge entry: a string, a JSON record, or a JSON array.         |
| `isJudgeQuestion` | function | `JudgeQuestion` | Checks whether a value is a well-formed judge question of the choice, score, or noul form. |

### Providers module

The `providers` module holds the inference boundary and its HTTP engine, the relay, the reasoning splitter, and the judge engine with the System One wire.

| API                         | Kind  | Shape    | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `THINK_OPEN`                | const | `string` | Names the opening tag a `ThinkSplitter` recognizes as the start of an in-content reasoning span — `'<think>'`, the de-facto wire convention thinking models (qwen3, DeepSeek-R1 family) emit their chain-of-thought under when a daemon renders it inline instead of on a separate wire field. Paired with `THINK_CLOSE`. |
| `THINK_CLOSE`               | const | `string` | Names the closing tag that ends a `THINK_OPEN` reasoning span — `'</think>'`. A span the stream never closes (the model was cut off mid-reasoning) is treated as thinking to its end, and `ThinkSplitterInterface.flush` settles it.                                                                                      |
| `DEFAULT_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`  | const | `number` | Holds the default provider deadline in milliseconds — `120_000`, the wall-clock bound a call runs under when `AgentProviderInput.timeout` is omitted, folded with the caller's signal so whichever trips first cancels the call.                                                                                          |
| `MAX_ERROR_BODY_LENGTH`     | const | `number` | Bounds the decoded error excerpt's input in bytes — `2048`, the leading bytes of a non-OK response body handed to the decoder before the read cancels the remainder, so a `ProviderError` message never carries a longer excerpt.                                                                                         |
| `DEFAULT_RELAY_LIMIT`       | const | `number` | Holds the default relay request limit in bytes — `1_048_576`, the byte budget a relay applies to an inbound body when `RelayOptions.limit` is omitted, refusing a body that reaches it.                                                                                                                                   |
| `RELAY_CONTENT_TYPE`        | const | `string` | Names the relay's newline-delimited JSON content type — `'application/x-ndjson; charset=utf-8'`, the header a relay response carries beside `cache-control: no-store`.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `RELAY_PROVIDER_MESSAGE`    | const | `string` | Names the public message for an unexpected upstream relay failure — `'relay provider failed'`, the fixed text every `error` frame carries, so an upstream failure's own message never reaches the browser.                                                                                                                |
| `UNAUTHORIZED_RELAY_STATUS` | const | `number` | Names the status a relay answers when the `authorize` callback returns anything but `true` or throws — `401`, carried with no body and reaching the browser as a `ProviderError` with the `HTTP` code.                                                                                                                    |
| `INVALID_RELAY_STATUS`      | const | `number` | Names the status a relay answers for a body that is missing, unreadable, or rejected by `providerRequestContract` — `400`, carried with no body and reaching the browser as a `ProviderError` with the `HTTP` code.                                                                                                       |
| `OVERSIZED_RELAY_STATUS`    | const | `number` | Names the status a relay answers for a request body at or above its byte budget — `413`, carried with no body and answered for an aborted inbound read as well.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `UPSTREAM_RELAY_STATUS`     | const | `number` | Names the status a relay answers when the upstream provider call cannot be constructed — `502`, carried with no body after `provider.stream` was entered and threw before returning its iterator.                                                                                                                         |
| `SYSTEM_ONE_PATH`           | const | `string` | Names the System One decision endpoint shared by compatible servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### Shapes and contracts

The JSON wire projections the relay validates against, and the contracts compiled from them, sit here. Each projection is strictly narrower than the domain type it mirrors: a value JSON cannot carry is refused rather than silently dropped, and a `ToolCall`'s `caller` is local context that never appears here.

A contract's `is` narrows an unknown record to its wire shape, and its `parse` projects one — returning the value stripped to that shape, or `undefined` when the value is invalid — so the same declaration guards an inbound body and shapes a frame written back out:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { providerRequestContract, relayFrameContract } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const upstream: ProviderInterface
declare const body: unknown
declare const signal: AbortSignal
declare function write(line: string): void

if (providerRequestContract.is(body)) {
	const result = await upstream.generate(body.messages, signal, body.tools, body.options)
	const frame = relayFrameContract.parse({ channel: 'result', result })
	write(`${JSON.stringify(frame)}\n`) // the newline-delimited record a relay writes back
}
relayFrameContract.is({ channel: 'error', message: 'relay provider failed' }) // true
relayFrameContract.is({ channel: 'error', message: 'oops', code: 'X' }) // false — an extra member is refused
relayFrameContract.parse({ channel: 'error', message: 'oops', code: 'X' }) // { channel: 'error', message: 'oops' } — parse projects the extra member away
```

| `CONVERSATION_RECAP_PREFIX` | const | `string` | Names the framing label a `ConversationInterface`'s `view()` prefixes onto each compacted section's summary so a small model reads it as a condensed recap of earlier turns — the lean `'[Summary of earlier messages] '` marker, never a literal assistant turn to echo or treat as the live answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `DEFAULT_CONVERSATION_KEEP` | const | `number` | Sets the default number of recent live messages a `ConversationInterface`'s `compact()` retains verbatim — `0`, so a manual `compact()` keeps no recent tail and folds every exchange before the newest user message into one summarized section. A caller retains a recent tail by passing `keep` (on `ConversationOptions`, `ConversationManagerOptions`, or per-fold through `CompactOptions`), folding at most the older `count - keep` messages, cut back to whole exchanges, and leaving at least the most recent `keep` live for the next turn. Overridable everywhere `keep` is accepted. |

| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ConversationError`   | class    | Reports a conversation with no `ConversationSummaryHandler` to fold its messages with, a `sections` cap below `1`, or a judgment or judge request that JSON cannot carry — thrown by a `ConversationInterface`'s `compact()`, its construction, or its judgment store, carrying the machine-readable `code` `'SUMMARIZER' \| 'SECTIONS' \| 'JUDGMENT'`. |
| `isConversationError` | function | Narrows an unknown caught value to a `ConversationError` through `instanceof`, so a `catch` can branch on its `code`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `createConversation`              | function | Creates a conversation — a `ConversationInterface` grouping messages above a flat message store it owns directly, with compaction into summarized sections, an opt-in rollup `summary`, on-demand `rehydrate`, and substring `search`, driven by a provider-agnostic `ConversationSummaryHandler` seam.                                                                                                          |
| `createConversationManager`       | function | Creates a conversation registry — a `ConversationManagerInterface` holding `ConversationInterface`s keyed by their `id`, in insertion order, with an active pointer: the id-keyed store over the conversation layer plus the `active` / `switch` seam the context renders. `add` auto-activates the first conversation and flows the registry's default `summarize` / `keep` into every conversation it creates. |
| `createMemoryConversationStore`   | function | Creates the in-memory conversation store — a `ConversationStoreInterface` backed by a process-lifetime `Map` of `ConversationSnapshot`s keyed by conversation id, the default backing for the durable `ConversationManagerInterface.open` / `ConversationManagerInterface.save` seam. The exact twin of `createMemoryWorkspaceStore`.                                                                            |
| `createDatabaseConversationStore` | function | Creates a `DatabaseConversationStore` over any `DriverInterface`, defaulting to `createMemoryDriver()` — the durable, driver-pluggable backing for the conversation persistence seam, holding each snapshot as one opaque JSON column and standing as the opt-in twin of `createMemoryConversationStore`. The exact twin of `createDatabaseWorkspaceStore`.                                                      |

| --------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Conversation`              | class | Represents a conversation — a live uncompacted tail of messages it owns directly above a flat message store, plus compacted, summarized `Section`s, an opt-in rollup `summary`, and a `summarizable` flag, with on-demand `rehydrate` and substring `search`, driven by a provider-agnostic `ConversationSummaryHandler` seam so `core` never imports a provider. Observable through its own `emitter`.                                             |
| `ConversationManager`       | class | Registers `Conversation`s keyed by `id`, in insertion order, with an active pointer — the id-keyed store over the conversation layer, the `active` / `switch` seam the `AgentContext` renders, and the durable `open` / `save` store seam. Event-free (a registry, like `WorkspaceManager`); the observability lives on each `Conversation`.                                                                                                        |
| `MemoryConversationStore`   | class | Implements the `ConversationStoreInterface` in memory — a process-lifetime `Map` of `ConversationSnapshot`s keyed by conversation id, the default store `createMemoryConversationStore` builds and the default backing for `open` / `save`. The exact twin of `MemoryWorkspaceStore`.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `DatabaseConversationStore` | class | Backs a `ConversationStoreInterface` with one table of the `databases` layer — a conversation's durable state is a row holding the snapshot as one opaque JSON column, narrowed back on `get` by `isConversationSnapshot`, so persistence reduces to keyed point-access (`get` / `set` / `delete`) over a `TableInterface`. The driver-pluggable twin of the plain-`Map` `MemoryConversationStore`, and the exact twin of `DatabaseWorkspaceStore`. |
| `JudgmentManager`           | class | Stores judgments in insertion order and asks a judge only for unmatched question identities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `buildSummaryMessage` | function | Builds the raw synthetic summary message for one compacted section — role `'assistant'`, the section's stable `id`, and its `summary` verbatim as content.                    |
| `buildRecapMessage`   | function | Builds the framed recap message for one compacted section — the same role and stable `id` as `buildSummaryMessage`, with the content prefixed by `CONVERSATION_RECAP_PREFIX`. |
| `buildJudgments`      | function | Builds records for answered or refused request keys, attaching usage only for a single question.                                                                              |
| `matchesJudgment`     | function | Matches a recorded question, ordered sources, rendered state, and judge identity by JSON text, so key order counts.                                                           |
| `collectToolGroups`   | function | Collects each assistant message that carries calls together with the tool messages that answer it, then each run of tool messages that no assistant message owns.             |

| `isSection`              | function | `Section`              | Checks whether an `unknown` is structurally a `Section` record — a `string` `id` and `summary` beside a `messages` array of valid `Message`s, the per-section step of the `isConversationSnapshot` read-boundary narrow. Total, never throwing, and never an assertion.                                                                                                                 |
| `isConversationSnapshot` | function | `ConversationSnapshot` | Narrows an `unknown` to a `ConversationSnapshot` — a `string` `id`, an optional `string` `summary`, and valid `sections` and `messages` arrays; the total boundary guard for an untrusted snapshot read (a storage row a `DatabaseConversationStore` reads back from its opaque JSON column, a snapshot loaded from disk), never throwing. The exact analogue of `isWorkspaceSnapshot`. |
| `isJudgment`             | function | `Judgment`             | Checks whether a stored judgment carries a valid question and exactly one answer or refusal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

A `DatabaseConversationStore` reads its snapshot column back as `unknown` and narrows it through `isConversationSnapshot`, so a malformed blob resolves `undefined` rather than a broken conversation:

```ts
import { isConversationSnapshot } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const row: unknown
const snapshot = isConversationSnapshot(row) ? row : undefined
```

### Contexts module

The `contexts` module holds the turn context, its instruction and scope managers, and the selection seam with the stock selection.

| `createAgentContext`       | function | Creates a richer turn context — an `AgentContextInterface` assembling a provider request from the optional system prompt, the instruction registry, the workspace registry (the only document channel), the conversation registry that is its `messages` source, the tool registry, and the active scope, which `build()` folds into the next turn's input. |

| `Instruction`        | class | Represents an immutable named directive — an `InstructionInterface` assembled once from its input (`name` / `content`, an optional `priority` defaulting to `0`), the `id` minted at construction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `InstructionManager` | class | Registers the immutable `Instruction`s a richer context assembles a directives block from — keyed by `name` so a re-`add` overwrites, last write wins, and listed by descending `priority`, carrying the `open` / `render` / `close` build contract and an observable `emitter`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Scope`              | class | Represents a named, immutable filter over a richer context's items — an optional allow-list per category (`instructions` / `tools` / `files`), each keyed by that category's identity (an instruction's `name`, a tool's `name`, a workspace file's `path`) and read as an allow-list: `undefined` lets everything pass, `[]` lets nothing pass, and a non-empty list passes the listed keys alone. `narrow` composes a tighter child by set intersection.                                             |
| `ScopeManager`       | class | Registers the named filters a richer context reuses — immutable `Scope`s keyed by their minted `id`, in insertion order, where `create` always mints and stores rather than overwriting, and an observable `emitter` reports each change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `AgentContext`       | class | Assembles a provider request from the richer turn context — the optional system prompt, the observable context managers (instructions / workspaces), the `ConversationManagerInterface` message source whose active conversation is `messages`, the `ToolManagerInterface` registry, and an active `ScopeInterface` changed through `AgentContextInterface.apply`. `build()` folds the scoped managers and the active workspace into one system block, then the conversation, and never reads `tools`. |

| `attachImages`            | function | Copies a message with image data merged onto its `images` — the message's own images first, then the attached data, carrying `calls` only when present and never mutating the original.                                            |
| `attachUserImages`        | function | Attaches image data to a conversation's last user message — the turn a vision provider reads images off — as a new array with that one message replaced by its carrying copy, and unchanged when there is no data or no user turn. |
| `collectImageData`        | function | Collects the `base64` payload of the image files in a workspace file list — the data an agent context attaches to the last user message.                                                                                           |
| `intersectKeys`           | function | Intersects two scope category lists under the "`undefined` is the universal set" rule — a fresh copy that can only tighten, and the primitive a scope narrows through.                                                             |

| ------------------------ | ----- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEFAULT_AGENT_LIMIT`    | const | `number` | Caps an `AgentInterface` turn's tool iterations by default — `10` context → provider → tools cycles before the loop stops, so a model that keeps requesting tools can never loop forever. Overridable per agent through `AgentOptions.limit`.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `DEFAULT_AUTHORITY_ZONE` | const | `string` | Names the zone an `AuthorityInterface`'s default fallback `AuthorityDecision` carries — `'default'`, the classification for a tool call that matched no rule. Paired with the default `allowed: true` fallback, an unmatched call is allowed under this zone, so a rules list of denials acts as a denylist; a caller wanting deny-by-default supplies an `allowed: false` `fallback` of their own (see `AuthorityOptions`). |
| `MESSAGE_TOKEN_OVERHEAD` | const | `number` | Estimates the per-message role and framing overhead `estimateMessages` adds on top of a message's content estimate — `4` tokens for the fixed wire framing every conversation turn carries (its role tag, its delimiters) that `estimateTokens`'s content-only heuristic does not otherwise capture.                                                                                                                         |
| `IMAGE_TOKEN_ESTIMATE`   | const | `number` | Names the coarse, deliberately approximate per-image token cost `estimateMessages` charges for each attached image — `512`, because a base64 payload's length is no reliable token proxy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `AgentJobError`   | class    | Reports an `AgentInterface` run that ended `AgentResult.partial` under a `partial` policy of `false` (the default) — thrown by an agent-job handler (a `createAgentQueue` / `createAgentRunner` job), carrying the partial `AgentResult` so the failure stays inspectable, and the machine-readable `code` `'PARTIAL'`.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `isAgentJobError` | function | Narrows an unknown caught value to an `AgentJobError` through `instanceof`, so a `catch` can recover its `partial` result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `AgentError`      | class    | Reports a concurrent run that would corrupt shared per-agent accounting, or a rehydration name absent from its registry pool — thrown synchronously by an `AgentInterface`'s `stream()` (and so by `generate()`, which calls it) and by an `AgentRegistryInterface`'s accessors, carrying the machine-readable `code` `'CONCURRENCY' \| 'REGISTRY'`. Synchronous means a fire-and-forget `agent.generate().catch(…)` never catches it: `await` the call inside `try`/`catch`, or wrap the call expression itself. |
| `isAgentError`    | function | Narrows an unknown caught value to an `AgentError` through `instanceof`, so a `catch` can branch on its `code`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| --------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `createAgent`         | function | Creates an agent loop — an `AgentInterface` composing a `ProviderInterface`, its `AgentContextInterface`, and a tool registry into a bounded context → provider → tools → repeat turn, exposed as a one-shot `generate` and a live `stream`.                                                                                           |
| `createAuthority`     | function | Creates a policy gate — an `AuthorityInterface` the agent loop consults before each tool call runs, evaluating the ordered rules first-match-wins and falling back to the configured default when none match.                                                                                                                          |
| `createChannel`       | function | Creates an empty unbounded async channel — a `ChannelInterface` a producer writes values into (`push`) and ends (`close` / `fail`) regardless of consumption, while a consumer reads them back live through `drain`.                                                                                                                   |
| `createAgentRegistry` | function | Creates an agent registry — an `AgentRegistryInterface` holding the named pools of live, non-serializable pieces (providers, tools, authorities, schedulers) that a serializable `AgentJobInput`'s names resolve against, and `build`ing a seeded, signal-wired `AgentInterface` from a job.                                           |
| `createAgentQueue`    | function | Creates a durable, bounded-concurrency agent-job queue — a `QueueInterface` over serializable `AgentJobInput`s that composes `createQueue`: each job is rehydrated through the `registry` into a live `AgentInterface`, run to its `AgentResult`, and subjected to the partial-as-configurable-failure policy.                         |
| `createAgentRunner`   | function | Creates an agent-job runner — a `RunnerInterface` over serializable `AgentJobInput`s that composes `createRunner` (one-shot, ordered, fail-fast), each unit rehydrated through the `registry` and subjected to the partial policy. The runner also carries sub-agent fan-out: a parent job's handler can `controller.spawn(childJob)`. |

| --------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Agent`         | class | Composes a `ProviderInterface`, an `AgentContext`, and a `ToolManagerInterface` into a bounded context → provider → tools → repeat turn, exposed as both a one-shot `generate` and a live `stream` that share one private run — bounded by the run `signal`, the `timeout`, and the `budget` folded through `AbortSignal.any`, paced by `scheduler`, with tool iteration capped at `limit`.                      |
| `Authority`     | class | Gates the agent loop's tool calls — the synchronous policy consulted before each call runs, turning one `AuthorityContext` into an `AuthorityDecision` by walking the ordered rules first-match-wins and falling back to a configurable default, which allows an unmatched call unless its `fallback` denies.                                                                                                    |
| `AgentRegistry` | class | Makes a durable, JSON-serializable `AgentJobInput` runnable — holds the named pools of live, non-serializable pieces (providers, tools, authorities, schedulers), throws on a name absent from its pool, and `build`s a seeded, signal-wired `Agent` from a job's names and data.                                                                                                                                |
| `Channel`       | class | Buffers chunks in a minimal unbounded async channel — the eager pump writes them in (`push`) and ends it (`close` / `fail`) regardless of consumption, while a consumer reads them back live through the `drain` async-iterator. Decoupling write from read is what lets a producer make progress without a consumer pulling, and it is why an agent's `result` settles whether or not its `events` are drained. |

| `agentResultToJSON`    | function | Projects an unknown value onto a fresh, exact `JSONValue` representation of an `AgentResult` — capturing each structural field once through a total boundary, accepting conforming accessors and inherited properties, preserving finite negative and fractional usage counts, dropping extras, and resolving `undefined` for a malformed field, a non-finite usage number, a throwing getter, or a hostile or revoked proxy. |
| `estimateTokens`       | function | Estimates the context-token footprint of a string — the deterministic `ceil(length / 4)` character heuristic `estimateMessages` sums over a conversation's messages (the default context-budget estimator).                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `estimateMessages`     | function | Estimates the context-token footprint of a batch of messages — each message's content plus `MESSAGE_TOKEN_OVERHEAD`, a tool-call JSON estimate, and `IMAGE_TOKEN_ESTIMATE` for each attached image. The default `consumer` estimator for an agent's context budget (the `AgentOptions` `window`), total and never throwing, and a deliberate provider-agnostic approximation rather than an exact tokenizer count.            |
| `settleAgentJob`       | function | Runs one rehydrated agent and applies the partial-as-configurable-failure policy — a partial run throws an `AgentJobError` unless the `partial` policy allows it, and a natural finish resolves. The shared job-handler step `createAgentQueue` and `createAgentRunner` both settle each job through, so the policy can never diverge between them.                                                                           |
| `handleAgentQueueJob`  | function | Handles one queued agent job by rehydrating it through a registry with the queue attempt's signal, then applying the shared partial-result policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `handleAgentRunnerJob` | function | Handles one runner agent job by fanning out its declared children, rehydrating the parent through a registry with the controller signal, and applying the shared partial-result policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `assembleResult`       | function | Assembles the settled `AgentResult` from a run's `RunOutcome` — `thinking` and `usage` are carried only when the run surfaced them, and the loop-internal `exhausted` flag is left out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `denyCall`             | function | Synthesizes the denial `ToolResult` an authority-blocked call is fed back with — the call's `id` / `name` keyed back, carrying a denial `error` instead of a value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `chargeUsage`          | function | Consumes a reported usage against a budget over what was already charged, so a turn's total draw matches the report and nothing is charged twice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Project an agent result at its originating package before carrying it through a JSON boundary:

```ts
import type { AgentResult } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { agentResultToJSON } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const result: AgentResult
const portable = agentResultToJSON(result)
if (portable === undefined) throw new Error('invalid agent result')
JSON.stringify(portable)
```

The queue and runner factories bind their named handlers to a registry and partial policy; callers composing the lower-level substrates can do the same:

```ts
import type { AgentRegistryInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { handleAgentQueueJob, handleAgentRunnerJob, sanitizeToken } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const registry: AgentRegistryInterface

const tokens = sanitizeToken(12.7) // 12
const queueHandler = handleAgentQueueJob.bind(undefined, registry, false)
const runnerHandler = handleAgentRunnerJob.bind(undefined, registry, false)
```

### Ledgers module

The `ledgers` module serves a conversation through an event-sourced briefing: the `Ledger` entity, the `Classifier` class that files messages through a judge, the `Gauge` class that prices a prompt, and the pure projection helpers. For the method, see [Serving a conversation through a ledger](#serving-a-conversation-through-a-ledger); for a ledger built end to end, see [Serving requests through a ledger](#serving-requests-through-a-ledger).

#### Types

The following table lists the types the ledger declares, each with its shape:

| Type                      | Kind      | Shape                                                                                                           | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `buildLines`         | function | `(input, byId, id, dead, holders, system) => readonly LedgerLine[]` | Builds the record lines of one message.                                                                     |

The `Classifier` and `Gauge` classes the ledger composes are public, so a harness can file a conversation or price a prompt without a ledger. The following classifier files one rule, and the following gauge prices the calls of one request:

```ts
import type { JudgeInterface, LedgerThreshold } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { Classifier, createConversation, Gauge, LEDGER_QUESTIONS } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const judge: JudgeInterface // answers 0.9 for the rule category and 0.9 for the topic
declare const thresholds: LedgerThreshold // fitted on LEDGER_QUESTIONS and this judge
declare const signal: AbortSignal

const conversation = createConversation()
const rule = conversation.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Refunds over $100 need a manager.' })
const classifier = new Classifier({
	conversation,
	judge,
	questions: LEDGER_QUESTIONS,
	topics: [{ name: 'refunds', criterion: 'refund amounts and approvals' }],
	thresholds,
	assign: () => undefined, // the judge decides every message
	entities: () => new Set(), // no lookups, so no shared id asks a pair question
})
const filed = await classifier.classify(new Set(), signal)
filed.judgments.length // 2 — the category question and the refunds topic question
classifier.category(rule.id) // 'rule'
classifier.decisive(rule.id) // true
classifier.quiet(rule.id) // false
classifier.topics(rule.id) // Set { 'refunds' }
classifier.classification().categories.get(rule.id) // 'rule'

const gauge = new Gauge({ scale: 1.25, fixed: 120, capacity: 32_768 })
const calls = [{ estimate: 400, prompt: 640, completion: 30, tools: 2 }]
gauge.measure([rule]) // 136.25 — the fixed 120 plus 1.25 for each of 13 estimate units
gauge.rate(calls) // 1.25 — the scale, because no two calls with one tool count are observed
gauge.left(calls) // 32098 — the capacity less the last call's prompt and completion
gauge.reserve(calls, '') // 36.25 — an empty reply and one recall call, priced at the rate
gauge.room(calls, '') // 12824.7 — half of what is left beyond the reserve, in estimate units
gauge.observe(calls)
gauge.scale // 1.3 — the first call's prompt less the fixed cost, over its estimate
```

Agent-owned readonly data members stay in the preceding Surface tables; their call-signature methods are documented under [`## Methods`](#methods). Tool contracts resolve to [`tool.md`](tool.md) and workspace contracts to [`workspace.md`](workspace.md) — neither dependency surface is duplicated or re-exported here. Note where the boundary falls inside the context: `instructions`, `conversations`, and `workspaces` are the managers `build()` renders a prompt from, while `tools` is loop machinery for advertising and dispatch and is never read by `build()` at all.

## Methods

The tables list every public call-signature member of `ProviderInterface`, `AgentProviderInterface`, `ProviderParserInterface`, `RelayProvider`, `JudgeInterface`, `AgentJudgeInterface`, `SystemOneJudge`, `ThinkSplitterInterface`, `JudgmentManagerInterface`, `MessageManagerInterface`, `InstructionManagerInterface`, `ScopeInterface`, `ScopeManagerInterface`, `AgentContextInterface`, `AgentInterface`, `StreamInterface`, `ChannelInterface`, `AuthorityInterface`, `AgentRegistryInterface`, `ConversationInterface`, `ConversationManagerInterface`, `ConversationStoreInterface`, `MemoryConversationStore`, `DatabaseConversationStore`, `LedgerInterface`, `ClassifierInterface`, and `GaugeInterface`. Their readonly data members remain Surface rows. `AgentProvider`, `AgentJudge`, `ThinkSplitter`, `InstructionManager`, `Scope`, `ScopeManager`, `AgentContext`, `Agent`, `Authority`, `AgentRegistry`, `Conversation`, `ConversationManager`, `JudgmentManager`, `Ledger`, `Classifier`, and `Gauge` implement their interfaces exactly, so the tables also describe those classes' instance methods. `RelayProvider`, `SystemOneJudge`, and the store classes keep explicit tables because their class names have no same-name interface contract. `MessageManagerInterface` has no separate concrete class here: the active `Conversation` satisfies it structurally. `RelayStream` exposes `response` alone, a data member, so it keeps its Surface row and takes no table. Tool and workspace methods live in their dependency guides.

#### `ProviderInterface`

`generate` produces one complete turn; `stream` yields `ProviderDelta`s and returns the assembled result. Both take the conversation, a bounding `AbortSignal`, optional `tools`, and optional per-call `ProviderStreamOptions`.

| Method     | Returns                                         | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generate` | `Promise<ProviderResult>`                       | Generates one complete turn — resolves the assembled `ProviderResult`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `stream`   | `AsyncGenerator<ProviderDelta, ProviderResult>` | Streams one turn — yields channel-tagged `content` / `thinking` `ProviderDelta`s as they arrive and returns the assembled `ProviderResult` (the concatenated content, any separated reasoning, any tool calls, and any usage) when the stream completes. A mid-stream abort throws a `ProviderAbortError` carrying the partial result. |

#### `AgentProviderInterface`

The seams a subclass fills, beneath the boundary members it inherits. `AgentProviderInterface` extends `ProviderInterface`, so `generate` and `stream` are part of it and repeat here with their boundary contracts; `AgentProvider` implements each of them once, for every subclass. A subclass writes `frame` / `body` / `read` / `finish` and nothing else. The `id` / `name` / `format` data members stay Surface rows.

| Method     | Returns                                         | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generate` | `Promise<ProviderResult>`                       | Generates one complete turn — resolves the assembled `ProviderResult`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `stream`   | `AsyncGenerator<ProviderDelta, ProviderResult>` | Streams one turn — yields channel-tagged `content` / `thinking` `ProviderDelta`s as they arrive and returns the assembled `ProviderResult` (the concatenated content, any separated reasoning, any tool calls, and any usage) when the stream completes. A mid-stream abort throws a `ProviderAbortError` carrying the partial result. |
| `frame`    | `ProviderParserInterface<TRecord>`              | Creates fresh framing state for a call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `body`     | `object`                                        | Projects a request to the concrete protocol's serializable body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `read`     | `ProviderIncrement`                             | Decodes a framed record into its contribution to the turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `finish`   | `readonly TRecord[]`                            | Returns records retained at end of input before the parser is cleared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### `ProviderParserInterface`

The framing seam a concrete provider hands the engine, one fresh instance for each call, so no call inherits another's half-read record. The engine feeds each decoded chunk to `parse` and clears the parser on every exit.

| Method  | Returns              | Summary                                       |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `parse` | `readonly TRecord[]` | Parses a decoded chunk into complete records. |
| `clear` | `void`               | Clears retained framing state.                |

#### `RelayProvider`

The relay wire over `AgentProvider`: it fills every seam and inherits `generate` / `stream` from the base, so a browser drives it exactly like a local provider. Its `name` reports `'relay'` and stays a data member.

| Method   | Returns                                            | Summary                                                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frame`  | `ProviderParserInterface`                          | Creates fresh framing state for each response.                                    |
| `body`   | `object`                                           | Projects declared request fields and refuses values the JSON wire cannot carry.   |
| `read`   | `ProviderIncrement`                                | Validates a relay frame and translates its channel into the shared stream engine. |
| `finish` | `ReadonlyArray<Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>>` | Recovers an unterminated final frame by completing its NDJSON line.               |

#### `JudgeInterface`

The decision boundary. `ask` is its only method; the `id`, `name`, and `model` data members stay Surface rows. It takes the request and a bounding `AbortSignal`.

| Method | Returns                | Summary                                                                            |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ask`  | `Promise<JudgeResult>` | Asks every question of the request about its state and returns the merged answers. |

#### `AgentJudgeInterface`

The seams a judge wire fills, beneath the boundary method it inherits. `AgentJudgeInterface` extends `JudgeInterface`, so `ask` is part of it and repeats here with its boundary contract; `AgentJudge` implements `ask` once, for every subclass. A subclass writes `body` and `read` and nothing else. The `id`, `name`, and `model` data members stay Surface rows.

| Method | Returns                | Summary                                                                             |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ask`  | `Promise<JudgeResult>` | Asks every question of the request about its state and returns the merged answers.  |
| `body` | `object`               | Projects one call's request onto the concrete protocol's serializable body.         |
| `read` | `JudgeResult`          | Decodes one call's parsed response body into the answers for that call's questions. |

#### `SystemOneJudge`

The System One wire over `AgentJudge`: it fills both seams and inherits `ask` from the engine, so a caller drives it through `JudgeInterface` like any judge. Its `name` reports `'systemone'` and stays a data member.

| Method | Returns            | Summary                                                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `body` | `SystemOneRequest` | Projects the state and questions onto the System One request with the configured model. |
| `read` | `JudgeResult`      | Decodes requested System One answers and reports the server model and available usage.  |

#### `ThinkSplitterInterface`

The stream-stateful `<think>…</think>` separator a provider routes raw content deltas through, so it yields clean content and surfaces the reasoning as `ProviderResult.thinking`. The `content` / `thinking` data members (the authoritative clean-content + reasoning accumulations) stay Surface rows — `content` matters because some chat templates pre-seed `<think>` into the prompt scaffold (the qwen3 shape), so only a bare `</think>` ever appears on the wire: before any tag event, that bare close reclassifies everything surfaced so far into `thinking` (one-shot — afterwards a bare close is plain text), correcting `content` retroactively where the already-returned deltas cannot be recalled. One splitter serves one stream — create a fresh one for each call (`createThinkSplitter`).

| Method  | Returns  | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `split` | `string` | Feeds one raw delta and returns the clean, non-think content to surface for it (possibly `''`) — a tag split across deltas is held until disambiguated, never leaked as content and never mis-eaten as thinking. |
| `flush` | `string` | Settles the stream end — a held partial tag that never completed returns as the final content delta, and an unclosed think span's tail lands on `thinking`.                                                      |

#### `JudgmentManagerInterface`

The conversation's judgment store. `add` stamps each record's `time` and carries batch overloads (one input → one record, a batch → the array), replacing an existing key in place; `remove` carries batch overloads (one key or a list). The `count` data member stays a Surface row.

| Method      | Returns                            | Summary                                                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `add`       | `Judgment` / `readonly Judgment[]` | Stores inputs with the current epoch milliseconds; an existing key is replaced. |
| `judgment`  | `Judgment \| undefined`            | Returns the record for a key, or `undefined` when absent.                       |
| `judgments` | `readonly Judgment[]`              | Returns stored records in insertion order.                                      |
| `remove`    | `boolean`                          | Removes every supplied key; returns `true` only when all were present.          |
| `clear`     | `void`                             | Removes all records.                                                            |
| `resolve`   | `Promise<readonly Judgment[]>`     | Reuses matching records and asks for the unmatched questions in one request.    |

#### `MessageManagerInterface`

The immutable conversation store. `add` mints each message's `id` and carries batch overloads (one input → one message, a batch → the array); `remove` carries batch overloads (one or a list). The `count` data member stays a Surface row.

| Method     | Returns                          | Summary                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `add`      | `Message` / `readonly Message[]` | Stores one `MessageInput`, or a batch — mints each message's `id` and returns the created message or messages; a stored message is immutable. |
| `message`  | `Message \| undefined`           | Looks up one stored message by id (`undefined` when absent).                                                                                  |
| `messages` | `readonly Message[]`             | Lists every stored message, in insertion order.                                                                                               |
| `remove`   | `boolean`                        | Removes one message by id, or a batch — `true` only when every supplied id was removed.                                                       |
| `clear`    | `void`                           | Removes every stored message.                                                                                                                 |

#### `InstructionManagerInterface`

The name-keyed instruction registry a richer context renders a directives block from. `add` mints each `id` and carries batch overloads (a re-`add` of the same name overwrites it, last write wins); `remove` carries batch overloads. The `emitter` / `count` / `open` / `close` data members stay Surface rows.

| Method         | Returns                                                    | Summary                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `add`          | `InstructionInterface` / `readonly InstructionInterface[]` | Adds one `InstructionInput`, or a batch — mints each `id`; a re-`add` of the same name overwrites it, last write wins. |
| `instruction`  | `InstructionInterface \| undefined`                        | Looks up one instruction by name (`undefined` when absent).                                                            |
| `instructions` | `readonly InstructionInterface[]`                          | Lists every instruction, sorted by descending `priority` (stable for equal priorities).                                |
| `render`       | `string`                                                   | Renders one instruction for the prompt — its `override`, else the manager-options `render`, else its `content`.        |
| `remove`       | `boolean`                                                  | Removes one instruction by name, or a batch — `true` only when every supplied name was removed.                        |
| `clear`        | `void`                                                     | Removes every instruction.                                                                                             |

#### `ScopeInterface`

The named, immutable allow-list filter. `narrow` is the only method — the `id` / `name` data members and the per-category allow-lists stay Surface rows.

| Method   | Returns          | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `narrow` | `ScopeInterface` | Composes a tighter child scope — each category is the set intersection of this scope's list and `config`'s (an `undefined` side imposing no constraint), returned as a new scope that leaves this one unchanged. |

#### `ScopeManagerInterface`

The id-keyed registry of reusable named scopes. `create` mints + stores a scope (always adds — never overwrites, because two scopes may share a `name`); `remove` carries batch overloads. The `emitter` / `count` data members stay Surface rows.

| Method   | Returns                       | Summary                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create` | `ScopeInterface`              | Mints a scope from a `ScopeInput` (an `id` plus the per-category allow-lists) and stores it — always adds, never overwrites. |
| `scope`  | `ScopeInterface \| undefined` | Looks up one scope by id (`undefined` when absent).                                                                          |
| `scopes` | `readonly ScopeInterface[]`   | Lists every scope, in insertion order.                                                                                       |
| `remove` | `boolean`                     | Removes one scope by id, or a batch — `true` only when every supplied id was removed.                                        |
| `clear`  | `void`                        | Removes every scope.                                                                                                         |

#### `AgentContextInterface`

The richer turn context. `apply` changes the active per-turn filter, `select` runs the selection handler for one request, and `build` assembles the provider input. The `system` / `instructions` / `messages` / `tools` / `scope` / `workspaces` / `conversations` readonly data members stay Surface rows.

| Method   | Returns                           | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apply`  | `void`                            | Applies the given scope as the active per-turn filter; passing `undefined` explicitly removes filtering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `select` | `Promise<Selection> \| undefined` | Runs the selection handler for one request — the active scope's `select`, else the agent default — and checks that the conversation did not change under it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `build`  | `readonly Message[]`              | Builds the provider input for the next turn: a leading `system` message folding the prompt, the scope-filtered instructions (each section's header and each item's rendering resolved through the format cascade), and the active workspace's scope-filtered (`scope.files`) text files as fenced reference blocks in a `## Workspace` section, then the active conversation's `view()`, or the selection's `messages` when a selection is passed, with the active workspace's image files' `base64` payload attached to the last user message. With no override set, each section renders on its manager's built-in framing. The `system` message is prepended only when some part of it exists, the workspace render covers the active workspace alone, tools are advertised structurally rather than in the prompt, and the input is built fresh on each call. |

#### `AgentInterface`

The bounded agent loop. `generate` and `stream` share one private run (`generate` drains the same stream `stream` exposes, so they can't diverge); `abort` cancels the in-flight turn. The `emitter` / `id` / `status` / `context` data members stay Surface rows (`emitter` is a `readonly` accessor — a property, not a method).

| Method     | Returns                | Summary                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generate` | `Promise<AgentResult>` | Runs the turn to completion, discarding the live chunks — drains the shared stream and resolves the settled `AgentResult` (`partial: true` when cancelled).                           |
| `stream`   | `AgentStreamInterface` | Runs the turn as a live stream — iterate `events` for `AgentChunk`s and `await result` for the settled outcome; `result` resolves partial on a cancel and rejects on a genuine error. |
| `abort`    | `void`                 | Cancels the in-flight turn — fires the turn's signal; the `result` settles `partial: true` with whatever content accumulated.                                                         |

#### `StreamInterface`

The generic live handle pairs its `events` and `result` data members with a cancellation method. `AgentStreamInterface` specializes it for `AgentChunk` and `AgentResult`.

| Method  | Returns | Summary                                                   |
| ------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `abort` | `void`  | Cancels the in-flight operation — fires its bound signal. |

#### `ChannelInterface`

The unbounded async channel. A producer writes with `push` and ends it with `close` or `fail`; a consumer reads it back live with `drain`. Write and read are decoupled, so the producer never waits for a consumer — an agent's eager pump writes each chunk into one, which is why the run's `result` settles whether or not `events` is ever drained. It carries no data members.

| Method  | Returns                   | Summary                                                                                                                                |
| ------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `push`  | `void`                    | Writes one value — buffered, then handed to a parked consumer; a value pushed at an already-parked reader is delivered, never dropped. |
| `close` | `void`                    | Ends the channel normally — a draining consumer returns after the buffer empties.                                                      |
| `fail`  | `void`                    | Ends the channel with a failure — a draining consumer throws it after the buffer empties; the first failure wins.                      |
| `drain` | `AsyncGenerator<T, void>` | Reads the values back live, in write order — returning on `close` and throwing on `fail`.                                              |

Buffered values are always delivered before the end is reported, so a `close` or `fail` arriving alongside the last values still hands them over first:

```ts
import { createChannel } from '@orkestrel/agent'

const channel = createChannel<number>()
channel.push(1)
channel.close()
for await (const value of channel.drain()) {
	value // 1
}

const failing = createChannel<number>()
failing.push(2)
failing.fail(new Error('upstream died')) // the 2 is delivered, then the drain throws
```

#### `AuthorityInterface`

The synchronous policy gate the agent loop consults before each tool call. `evaluate` is the only method — it has no data members.

| Method     | Returns             | Summary                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `evaluate` | `AuthorityDecision` | Evaluates one tool call against the ordered rules — returns the first matching rule's verdict, which allows unless `allowed: false`, or the fallback when none match. |

#### `AgentRegistryInterface`

The job-rehydration bridge. `provider` / `tool` / `authority` / `scheduler` resolve a name against their pool (throwing `unknown <category>: <name>` on a miss); `build` rehydrates a seeded, signal-wired agent from a serializable job. It has no data members.

| Method      | Returns              | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider`  | `ProviderInterface`  | Resolves a registered `ProviderInterface` by name — throws `unknown provider: <name>` when absent.                                                                                                                    |
| `tool`      | `ToolInterface`      | Resolves a registered `ToolInterface` by name — throws `unknown tool: <name>` when absent.                                                                                                                            |
| `authority` | `AuthorityInterface` | Resolves a registered `AuthorityInterface` by name — throws `unknown authority: <name>` when absent.                                                                                                                  |
| `scheduler` | `SchedulerInterface` | Resolves a registered `SchedulerInterface` by name — throws `unknown scheduler: <name>` when absent.                                                                                                                  |
| `build`     | `AgentInterface`     | Rehydrates a live, seeded `AgentInterface` from a serializable `AgentJobInput` — resolving its names, rebuilding its token budget, seeding its conversation, and wiring `signal`; a name absent from its pool throws. |

#### `ConversationInterface`

A conversation that owns its live message tail directly (the flat store verbs folded in, like a `Workspace` owns its files). `add` mints each message's `id` and stores it (batch overloads); `message` / `messages` look up the live tail; `remove` / `clear` drop from it. `view` is the model input; `compact` folds the older live messages into a summarized `Section` (regenerating the rollup when the `rollup` option is `true`, emitting `summary` for it, then `compact`); `rehydrate` / `search` read the retained originals; `reference` renders this conversation as a provenance-labeled block to pull into another (a pure string, no model call). The `id` / `judgments` / `emitter` / `summary` / `sections` / `summarizable` / `count` data members stay Surface rows (`emitter` is a `readonly` accessor — a property, not a method).

| Method      | Returns                          | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `add`       | `Message` / `readonly Message[]` | Appends one `MessageInput` to the live tail, or a batch — mints each message's `id` (a random UUID) and returns the created message or messages; a stored message is immutable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `message`   | `Message \| undefined`           | Looks up one live message by id (`undefined` when absent).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `messages`  | `readonly Message[]`             | Lists every live, uncompacted message in the tail, in insertion order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `remove`    | `boolean`                        | Removes one live message by id, or a batch, from the tail — `true` only when every supplied id was removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `clear`     | `void`                           | Empties the live tail, leaving the compacted `sections` untouched.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `view`      | `readonly Message[]`             | Builds the model input for the next turn — each section as one synthetic recap message, its summary prefixed with `CONVERSATION_RECAP_PREFIX` so a small model reads it as a recap rather than a literal turn, then the live tail verbatim; the rollup `summary` is not injected.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `compact`   | `Promise<Section \| undefined>`  | Folds whole exchanges from the oldest `count - keep` live messages, cut short at the newest user message, into a summarized `Section` through the `ConversationSummaryHandler`, removes them from the live tail, regenerates the rollup when the `rollup` option is `true`, and emits `summary` (only for a regenerated rollup) then `compact` — resolving `undefined` when nothing folds. Throws a `ConversationError` when no summarizer was supplied. |
| `rehydrate` | `readonly Message[]`             | Returns a section's full original messages — a pure read that emits `rehydrate`, empty for an unknown id and never reinserting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `search`    | `readonly Message[]`             | Searches `content` for a case-insensitive substring across every message — each section's retained originals, then the live tail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `reference` | `string`                         | Renders this conversation as a self-labeled, fenced provenance block to pull into another conversation — a pure string with no model call: a leading `[Reference — conversation "<label>" — NOT part of this conversation]` marker, the rollup `Summary:` when `summary` is not `false` and a rollup exists, and the cherry-picked excerpts (`- role: content`) when `messages` is supplied. `label` defaults to the `id`.                               |
| `snapshot`  | `ConversationSnapshot`           | Serializes this conversation to a plain, JSON-serializable `ConversationSnapshot` — its `id`, the rollup `summary`, the compacted `sections`, and the live tail; the live `summarize` / `keep` are configuration re-supplied on hydrate rather than serialized.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

#### `ConversationManagerInterface`

The id-keyed registry of `Conversation`s with an active pointer. `add(input?)` mints a conversation (flowing the manager's default `summarize` / `keep` in unless the input overrides them) and auto-activates the first one; a later `add` leaves `active` unchanged. `switch(id)` re-points `active` (an unknown `id` returns `undefined`, leaving `active` unchanged — lenient, never throws); `remove` carries batch overloads (the array overload first) and clears `active` when the removed conversation was active. The `count` and `active` data members stay Surface rows (`active` is a `readonly` accessor — a property, not a method); the manager is event-free (each conversation owns its `emitter`).

| Method          | Returns                                       | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conversation`  | `ConversationInterface \| undefined`          | Looks up one conversation by id (`undefined` when absent).                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `conversations` | `readonly ConversationInterface[]`            | Lists every conversation, in insertion order.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `add`           | `ConversationInterface`                       | Mints a conversation, taking its `id` from the input or a fresh UUID and flowing the manager's default `summarize` / `keep` in unless the input overrides them — auto-activates the first, and an already-present `id` overwrites, last write wins. |
| `switch`        | `ConversationInterface \| undefined`          | Re-points `active` at the conversation with `id` and returns it; an unknown `id` returns `undefined` and leaves `active` unchanged, never throwing.                                                                                                 |
| `open`          | `Promise<ConversationInterface \| undefined>` | Resolves a conversation by id and activates it — from the registry when present, else hydrated from the optional `ConversationStoreInterface` (`store`); `undefined` when it is neither registered nor stored.                                      |
| `save`          | `Promise<boolean>`                            | Persists a registered conversation's `ConversationInterface.snapshot` to the optional `ConversationStoreInterface` (`store`) — `true` when persisted, `false` when there is no store or the id is unknown, and never throwing.                      |
| `remove`        | `boolean`                                     | Removes one conversation by id, or a batch — `true` only when every supplied id was removed; clears `active` when a removed conversation was the active one.                                                                                        |
| `clear`         | `void`                                        | Removes every conversation and clears `active`.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

#### `ConversationStoreInterface`

The persistence contract stores a `ConversationSnapshot` under its own identity.

| Method   | Returns                                      | Summary                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get`    | `Promise<ConversationSnapshot \| undefined>` | Resolves the persisted snapshot for `id`, or `undefined` if none is stored.                                                      |
| `set`    | `Promise<void>`                              | Inserts or replaces a snapshot under its own `snapshot.id` (no separate id param — mirroring `WorkspaceStoreInterface`'s `set`). |
| `delete` | `Promise<void>`                              | Drops a snapshot by id; an absent id is a no-op (no throw).                                                                      |

#### `MemoryConversationStore`

The in-memory implementation keeps an explicit table because its class name has no same-name interface contract.

| Method   | Returns                                      | Summary                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get`    | `Promise<ConversationSnapshot \| undefined>` | Resolves the persisted snapshot for `id`, or `undefined` if none is stored.                                                      |
| `set`    | `Promise<void>`                              | Inserts or replaces a snapshot under its own `snapshot.id` (no separate id param — mirroring `WorkspaceStoreInterface`'s `set`). |
| `delete` | `Promise<void>`                              | Drops a snapshot by id; an absent id is a no-op (no throw).                                                                      |

#### `DatabaseConversationStore`

The driver-backed implementation keeps an explicit table because its class name has no same-name interface contract.

| Method   | Returns                                      | Summary                                                                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `get`    | `Promise<ConversationSnapshot \| undefined>` | Resolves the persisted snapshot for `id`, narrowing the opaque JSON column back to a `ConversationSnapshot`. |
| `set`    | `Promise<void>`                              | Inserts or replaces under the snapshot's own `id` (no separate id param) — the row is `{ id, snapshot }`.    |
| `delete` | `Promise<void>`                              | Drops a snapshot by id; an absent id is a no-op (no throw).                                                  |

#### `LedgerInterface`

The conversation ledger. The `respond` method serves one request through to its reply, and the `calibrate` method measures the price of a prompt. The `agent`, `conversation`, and `gauge` data members stay Surface rows. A call to either method while the other or itself is in flight rejects with `AgentError` code `CONCURRENCY`.

| Method      | Returns                 | Summary                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `respond`   | `Promise<LedgerResult>` | Appends `content` as a user message and serves it through to its reply. |
| `calibrate` | `Promise<LedgerGauge>`  | Measures the gauge, holds it as `gauge`, and returns it.                |

#### `ClassifierInterface`

The ledger's filing engine. The `classify` method asks the judge what the conversation's recorded judgments lack, and the readers derive every answer from those judgments and the cutoffs. It carries no data members.

| Method           | Returns                       | Summary                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `classify`       | `Promise<ClassifierResult>`   | Asks every filing question the conversation's judgments lack an answer for.                      |
| `category`       | `LedgerCategory \| undefined` | Returns the category a message is filed under, or undefined when no category reaches its cutoff. |
| `quiet`          | `boolean`                     | Returns true if the message is filed as quiet; false otherwise.                                  |
| `decisive`       | `boolean`                     | Returns true if the message is filed as decisive; false otherwise.                               |
| `topics`         | `ReadonlySet<string>`         | Returns the desk topics the message is filed under.                                              |
| `classification` | `LedgerClassification`        | Returns the filing of every message in the conversation.                                         |

#### `GaugeInterface`

The prompt price. The `measure` method prices messages, the `rate`, `left`, `reserve`, and `room` methods read the calls of the request in progress, and the `observe` method folds a finished request in. The `scale` and `fixed` data members stay Surface rows.

| Method    | Returns  | Summary                                                                                              |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `measure` | `number` | Returns the tokens the messages cost at the current scale.                                           |
| `rate`    | `number` | Returns the tokens one more estimate unit adds within a request, fitted over the observed calls.     |
| `left`    | `number` | Returns the tokens of the capacity the last call left.                                               |
| `reserve` | `number` | Returns the tokens a reply turn needs after the calls, given the longest reply text written so far.  |
| `room`    | `number` | Returns the estimate units a recall result can take without taking the reply's room.                 |
| `observe` | `void`   | Rescales from a completed request's first call and keeps its calls and the final reply's completion. |

## Contract

These invariants hold across `src/core` ↔ `agent.md`:

1. **Doc ↔ source bijection.** Every row in the `## Surface` tables is a real export of `src/core`, and every export appears as a Surface row.
2. **`ProviderInterface` is the inference boundary; `AgentProvider` is the engine behind it.** A provider turns a conversation, optional `tools`, and optional `ProviderStreamOptions` into a turn: `generate` resolves the assembled `ProviderResult`, and `stream` yields channel-tagged `ProviderDelta`s and returns the same result. `AgentProvider` owns the deadline, the transport, the `headers` hook, the bounded error read, the decode loop, reasoning separation, and result assembly, and a subclass supplies one vendor's wire through `frame`, `body`, `read`, and `finish`. The loop and its tools run in the host that constructs them; see [Placement proofs](#placement-proofs) for each placement's receipt.
3. **`stream` yields deltas and returns the assembled result.** `stream` yields each non-empty answer delta as `{ channel: 'content', text }` and each native reasoning delta as `{ channel: 'thinking', text }`, and returns the `ProviderResult` whose `content` is the authoritative clean answer. A provider reading a raw wire routes content through a per-stream `ThinkSplitter` armed by `split` and surfaces the reasoning as `ProviderResult.thinking`, which the agent records on the assistant message and sends back only as the provider's `replay` policy permits. `RelayProvider` constructs with `split: false`, so it preserves each upstream delta verbatim, a literal `<think>` tag included.
4. **Usage reuses `TokenUsage`.** `ProviderResult.usage` is the [budgets](budget.md) `TokenUsage` shape `{ prompt, completion, total }`, present only when the turn reported it.
5. **The caller's signal and the engine's deadline both bound the call.** `generate` and `stream` take an `AbortSignal`, and an already-aborted signal rejects before any content streams. `AgentProvider` folds a per-call `Timeout` of `AgentProviderInput.timeout` milliseconds (`DEFAULT_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT` when omitted) with that signal through `AbortSignal.any`, covering the `headers` hook, the error-body read, and the stream. The deadline is cleared on every exit.
6. **A local cancel and a remotely reported one are different failures.** A `stream` cancelled by its bound throws `ProviderAbortError` whose `partial` holds what was assembled locally, with a throw that raced the cancel carried as its `cause`. A relay `abort` frame makes `RelayProvider.read` throw a reconstructed `ProviderAbortError` carrying the upstream partial while the local signal stays unaborted, and the engine propagates that instance unchanged.
7. **The message-store contract (`MessageManagerInterface`).** `context.messages` is typed to `MessageManagerInterface`, which the active `Conversation` satisfies structurally. `add` mints each message's `id`, carries `calls` only when supplied, and returns the stored immutable message that `message(id)` later resolves; `remove` reports `true` only when every supplied id was removed.
8. **The richer turn context (`AgentContext`).** `AgentContext` composes the optional `system` prompt, the `instructions`, `workspaces`, and `conversations` managers, `messages`, the `tools` registry, and a readonly active `scope`, creating each omitted manager fresh. `build()` folds the system prompt, the scope-filtered instructions, and the active workspace's scope-filtered text files into one leading `system` message, with a passed selection's non-empty `briefing` as its last part when the selection has no `fault`, then appends the active conversation's `view()`, or a passed selection's `messages`. It never reads `tools`, never mutates a manager or a stored message, and builds fresh on each call.
9. **Scope filtering.** A scope holds one three-way allow-list per category (`instructions` by `name`, `tools` by `name`, `files` by `path`), applied through `filterAllowList`, and `narrow` intersects each list, so narrowing only tightens. The scope's filters never touch messages; message inclusion is the conversation's through compaction and, when a handler is set, the selection's. The loop filters the advertised definitions by `scope.tools`, so a scoped-out tool is neither described nor callable, and `build()` never contains a tool's name or schema.
10. **The agent loop (`Agent` / `createAgent`).** `Agent` builds the provider input, then iterates up to `limit`: stream a turn, fold its usage, append any assistant tool calls, and dispatch them. Each `ToolResult` becomes a tool message whose `call` names the paired call, in the reply's call order, because ids can repeat; a string value is the content unchanged, another value is `JSON.stringify(result.value)`, and a failure's content is its `error`. A reply with no tool calls ends the loop.
11. **One run shared by `generate` and `stream`.** `generate` drains the private run `stream` exposes, so a `generate` result deep-equals a drained `stream` on the same input.
12. **The `AgentChunk` stream.** `stream().events` yields, per turn, each answer delta as `token`, each reasoning delta as `think`, then optional `usage`, then one `tool` chunk per dispatched call. `result` resolves the settled `AgentResult`: the content, the joined thinking, the summed optional usage, and `partial`.
13. **Bounded, paced, capped.** Each run folds the external `signal`, the `timeout`, and the `budget` signal into one cancel; a cancel resolves `{ partial: true, content }` with what streamed, while a genuine provider or tool error rejects `result` and sets `status` to `error`. `scheduler.yield` runs between turns and never after the last, and `limit` caps tool iteration.
14. **Pull and push observation on the `Agent`; the rest event-free.** The provider contract, the conversation registry, and the context carry no emitter, while the instruction and scope managers and each conversation own one. The `Agent` pairs the `AgentChunk` stream with an `emitter` over `AgentEventMap` (`start`, `turn`, `tool`, `usage`, `deny`, `finish`, `error`, `abort`, `exhaust`, `fault`, `select`) and has no `token` or `think` event. The emitter routes a listener throw to the `error` option, and a cancelled run emits `abort` then `finish`.
15. **Doc ↔ source method bijection.** The `## Methods` tables list exactly the call-signature members of every interface named there, and each implementing class exposes exactly its interface's methods.
16. **The authority gate (`Authority` / `createAuthority`).** `evaluate({ call })` walks the ordered `rules` first-match-wins, a matched rule allowing unless its `allowed` is `false`, and returns the `fallback` when none match, which defaults to `{ zone: DEFAULT_AUTHORITY_ZONE, allowed: true }`. It is synchronous and event-free.
17. **A denied call is fed back, never executed.** The loop consults `authority` after scope admits a call, and a denied call becomes the failure arm `{ success: false, id, name, error }` without running the tool. Executed results and denials merge in the reply's call order, each producing a `tool` chunk and a tool message.
18. **Durable, serializable agent jobs (`AgentJobInput` + `AgentRegistry`).** An `AgentJobInput` names its `provider`, `tools`, `authority`, and `scheduler` and carries its data directly, and `AgentRegistry.build(input, signal?)` rehydrates a seeded, signal-wired `Agent` from the named pools. An unknown name throws `AgentError` with code `REGISTRY` and the message `unknown <category>: <name>`.
19. **Partial is a configurable failure (`partial`).** A durable job's handler throws `AgentJobError` carrying the partial `AgentResult` unless `partial: true`, which resolves the partial as success. `isAgentJobError` narrows a caught value.
20. **Concurrency, retries, and persistence come from the substrate.** `createAgentQueue` composes `createQueue` and `createAgentRunner` composes `createRunner`, adding only rehydration through the registry and the partial policy.
21. **Sub-agent fan-out through `controller.spawn`.** A runner job's handler spawns each declared child through `controller.spawn`, and the child runs as a sub-agent beside the parent. Both pass their signal into `registry.build`, so a queue or runner cancel commits the rehydrated agent's partial.
22. **The conversation layer (`Conversation` + `ConversationManager`).** `compact()` folds the oldest `count - keep` live messages through the `ConversationSummaryHandler` into a `Section`, stopping before the newest user message, moving a cut back to the user message that opens its exchange so a fold removes whole exchanges, and moving a cut that would split an assistant call from its tool results before that call, regenerates the rollup `summary` when the `rollup` option is `true`, emits `summary` for a regenerated rollup then `compact`, and throws `ConversationError` with code `SUMMARIZER` when no summarizer was supplied. `view()` renders each section as one assistant recap prefixed with `CONVERSATION_RECAP_PREFIX`, then the live tail, while `rehydrate`, `search`, and `reference` are pure reads. `ConversationManager` is the event-free id-keyed registry with an active pointer, `switch`, and the `open` / `save` store seam.
23. **The context's message source.** `context.messages` is the `conversations` registry's active conversation, always defined and read on each access, so it follows `conversations.switch(id)`. The `Agent` reads it fresh on each run, so one agent serves many conversations by switching between runs.
24. **Automatic compaction (the context `window` budget).** With `AgentOptions.window` set and a summarizable active conversation, the loop measures the working message array alone against the window before the first provider request and between turns, with tool definitions and a per-run schema unmeasured, and compacts and rebuilds when the window is exhausted. A summarizer throw emits `fault` and the run continues over-window unless `strict` is set, and a fold that compacts nothing between turns while over the window stops auto-compaction for the rest of the run. A run whose signal aborted by the end of tool dispatch folds nothing before it settles. When no selection handler runs, and either `window` is absent or the active conversation has no summarizer, the loop adds no `await` before the first provider request.
25. **Active workspace rendering by carrier.** `build()` reads only the active workspace, filters its files through `scope.files`, renders text files under `WORKSPACE_SECTION_HEADER` through `renderFencedFile`, and attaches the base64 data of binary `image/` files to a copy of the last user message. With no active workspace, nothing renders.
26. **The durable `ConversationStore` + the manager's `open` / `save` seam.** A `ConversationSnapshot` is the JSON payload `{ id, summary?, sections, messages, judgments? }`, created by `snapshot()` and restored through `ConversationInput.snapshot` without emitting events. `MemoryConversationStore` keeps snapshots in a map and `DatabaseConversationStore` in one opaque JSON column narrowed by `isConversationSnapshot`, both through `get`, `set`, and `delete`. `open(id)` activates a registry hit or hydrates a store hit, and `save(id)` returns `false` when no store or conversation exists.
27. **Limit exhaustion, mid-stream budget charging, and per-run options.** A run that exhausts `limit` while its last turn still requested tools settles `partial: true` and emits `exhaust` instead of `abort`. The loop charges the cost `budget` mid-stream from the `estimateTokens` estimate of each turn's content and reconciles to the reported usage after the turn, never charging twice. `AgentRunOptions` members override their construction defaults for one run, a per-run `signal` composes with the constructed one, and `think` and `schema` reach the provider in one options object, omitted when both are absent.
28. **Construction-time context wiring.** `AgentOptions.instructions`, `workspaces`, `scope`, `conversations`, and `select` forward into the `AgentContext` the constructor builds.
29. **`strict` — fault escalation.** With `AgentOptions.strict` set, an automatic-compaction summarizer failure and each selection fault emit `fault` and then settle the run `error`; without it, the run continues. A cancel at a select site wins over `strict`, and a manual `conversation.compact()` always propagates its own error.
30. **Bounded `sections`.** A `sections` cap, set per conversation, as a manager default, or per `compact()` call, bounds `Conversation.sections`; when a fold exceeds it, the oldest sections merge into one through a summarizer call and `collapse` fires. A cap below 1 throws `ConversationError` with code `SECTIONS`.
31. **`sanitizeUsage`.** `sanitizeToken` turns a non-finite or non-positive count into `0` and floors a positive fraction, and `sanitizeUsage` applies it to each field. The loop sanitizes a provider's usage and an abort partial's usage before charging or folding it.
32. **`AgentError` — the concurrency guard.** `stream()` throws `AgentError` with code `CONCURRENCY` synchronously when a run is in flight and the run being started would share a construction-level `window` or `budget`; a run with its own per-run `budget` and no `window` is allowed. `isAgentError` narrows a caught value.
33. **`agentResultToJSON` — the portable `AgentResult` projection.** The helper accepts `unknown`, never throws, reads each structural field once, and returns a fresh exact `{ content, thinking?, usage?, partial }` `JSONValue`, or `undefined` for invalid input. Finite negative and fractional usage counts are preserved, and extra fields are dropped.
34. **The provider engine's request and stream.** The engine posts `JSON.stringify(body(request))` to `url + (path ?? '')` with a JSON content type the `headers` hook can extend, decodes the body through `readChunks`, and feeds every framed record and the `finish` tail through `read`. A record whose `read` returns a `result` ends the call with that result, and with `strict: true` a stream that ends with no settled result throws `ProviderError` with code `PROTOCOL`. A non-OK body is read through `readText` to at most `MAX_ERROR_BODY_LENGTH` bytes and its remainder cancelled, and each reader releases its lock on every exit.
35. **The wire shapes and the compiled contracts.** The shapes declare each JSON projection and the contracts compile them, each strictly narrower than its domain type, so a value JSON cannot carry is refused rather than dropped and a `ToolContext` appears in no wire shape. `RelayProvider.body` sends an owned snapshot cloned through property descriptors, so a getter, a prototype, or an own `toJSON` serializer is never consulted, and a non-JSON value is refused before fetching.
36. **The relay protocol (`createRelay` / `RelayStream` / `RelayProvider`).** The request is a `POST` of one `providerRequestContract` document, and the response is newline-delimited `RelayFrame` records under `RELAY_CONTENT_TYPE`, written under backpressure, with every upstream failure reduced to `RELAY_PROVIDER_MESSAGE`. `authorize` is mandatory and runs before the body is read; the handler answers `401`, `413` at the byte `limit`, `400`, or `502` with no body, and the browser receives each as a `ProviderError` with code `HTTP`. An inbound abort, a client disconnecting included, cancels the upstream turn.
37. **`ProviderError` and its codes.** `ProviderError` carries a `code` and, for `HTTP` alone, a `status`: `HTTP` reports a non-OK response as `provider error: <status>` with ` - <excerpt>` only when the error body had text, `PROTOCOL` a missing body, a refused record, or a `strict` stream with no settled result, and `PROVIDER` a relay `error` frame. A cancel throws `ProviderAbortError`, never `ProviderError`.
38. **The judge boundary (`JudgeInterface`).** `JudgeInterface` is the sibling of `ProviderInterface` and never a provider: `ask(request, signal)` answers each question of a `JudgeRequest` about its one `state`, keyed by caller ids the model never sees. An id appears in `answers` or in `refusals`, never both, `refusals` is absent when nothing was refused, and a `Refusal` invents no probability.
39. **The stored distribution and the derived reading (`computeReading`).** An answer stores only its distribution, and `computeReading` derives the `Reading`: `winner` is the first strictly greatest candidate in enumeration order, so a noul of exactly 0.5 names `'false'`, and `probability` is the winner's. `confidence` is `(max(p) - 1/n) / (1 - 1/n)` for a choice, `|2p - 1|` for a noul, and for a score one minus the probability-weighted distance from the winning level over the mean distance from the middle level, floored at 0, and `score`, the expected level `sum(i * p_i)`, is set for a score answer alone. A choice or score with fewer than 2 candidates throws `JudgeError` with code `PROTOCOL`.
40. **The protocol's null and the absence law.** An undescribed choice option or score level stays `null`, because JSON carries no `undefined` member and a level is positional, while `instructions`, `NoulCriteria`, and each noul side are omitted when absent and `isJudgeQuestion` refuses a `null` there. The System One wire sends an omitted member omitted and a `null` criterion as `null`.
41. **Validation before inference and the server's limits.** `ask` refuses an invalid `state`, an empty question map, or a question `isJudgeQuestion` rejects with `JudgeError` code `QUESTION` before any call, and a wire can refuse its own limits the same way. A server refusal throws code `HTTP` with the response `status` and the message `judge error: <status>`, plus ` - <excerpt>` read from at most `MAX_ERROR_BODY_LENGTH` bytes when the body has text, and a `null` or non-JSON success body throws code `PROTOCOL`.
42. **Each call's own deadline, and the abort partial (`JudgeAbortError`).** Each call runs under a `Timeout` of `AgentJudgeInput.timeout` milliseconds (`DEFAULT_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT` when omitted) folded with the caller's signal, covering the `headers` hook, the transport, both body reads, and `read`. A cancel throws `JudgeAbortError` whose `partial` merges the answers, refusals, and usage of the completed calls, with a throw that raced the cancel as its `cause`. A cancel that lands while `read` decodes the answer is reported with no `cause`, and that call's answer is left out of the `partial`.
43. **The batch switch and the merge (`buildJudgeResult`).** `AgentJudgeInput.batch` (default `true`) sends every question in one call, and `false` sends one call per question in key order with the shared `state`, every body built before the first call. `buildJudgeResult` joins answers and refusals by id, sums each call's sanitized usage, and takes `model` from the first call, or the configured `model` when no call completed.
44. **The System One wire (`SystemOneJudge` / `createSystemOneJudge`).** `SystemOneJudge` posts every question in one call to `url` plus `SYSTEM_ONE_PATH`, writing `form` as `type` and leaving an omitted member omitted, and decodes each requested id in criteria order, accepting a score's `probabilities` as a map or an array. It ignores unrequested answers and the server's `confidence`, `score`, `choice`, and `legend` members, so `computeReading` derives every measure locally. A System One server answers only from the supplied options, so the wire never reports a refusal: a missing, mismatched, or out-of-range answer throws `JudgeError` with code `PROTOCOL` naming the question id.
45. **The System One response model and usage.** On the System One wire, `JudgeResult.model` reports the model the response named, verbatim, and a response that names no model reports the configured `model` option. `extractSystemOneUsage` maps `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` onto `{ prompt, completion, total }`, and `usage` is absent when either count is missing, `null`, negative, or not finite.
46. **Header-hook authentication.** Both engines read the `headers` hook through `readHeaders`: the headers start from `Content-Type: application/json`, the hook is awaited with the call's combined signal and raced against it, and each entry it returns is set over the defaults.
47. **Two selection homes.** `AgentOptions.select` is the agent default and the active scope's `select` overrides it, and `context.select` resolves the handler once per call and returns `undefined` when neither home holds one, so the default path awaits nothing.
48. **Select sites and the receipt.** The loop calls the handler with the request captured at run entry and the run's signal at run entry, the pre-first-turn compaction fold, and each compaction rebuild, folds the result through `build(selection)`, which appends a non-empty `briefing` as the last system part unless the selection has a `fault`, and then emits `select`. A `Selection` has no tool member, so advertising and admission stay the scope's.
49. **Selection faults.** A thrown handler, a returned `fault`, and a conversation changed under the handler each emit `fault`; a throw builds from `view()` with no `select` event, and a returned `fault` charges its usage before `fault` fires. A cancel at a select site wins over every fault, and the run commits partial without a further provider call.
50. **Selection cost.** Selection usage is charged in full to the cost `budget` and folded into `AgentResult.usage`, with no `usage` chunk or `usage` event.
51. **Judgments.** A conversation's `judgments` store keys each record by the caller's question id, last write wins in place, stamps `time` on `add`, and attaches `usage` only for a one-question request. `resolve` reuses each record whose question JSON text, ordered sources, rendered state, and configured judge `model` match, asks once for the rest, and keeps the completed records when a cancel interrupts it.
52. **Judgments in a snapshot.** A snapshot carries `judgments` only while the store holds one, and a snapshot without the member validates and restores.
53. **The stock selection (`createSelection`).** `createSelection` throws `SelectionError` unless `threshold` lies above 0.5 and at most 1 and `limit` is a nonnegative safe integer, and each call removes an earlier request's `needed` judgments before asking `NEEDED_QUESTION` about each screened subject within `limit` fresh questions. It drops a subject only on a decisive no, never drops the request, keeps an exchange and a tool group whole when any member is kept, and returns a subset of `view()` in view order.
54. **The stock selection's failure.** A judge error for one subject leaves that subject undecided and the handler continues. When the judge fails for every subject asked and no recorded judgment is reused, the handler returns a `Selection` with `fault` set, its cause the first judge error, and `messages` as `view()`. A cancel returns `fault`, `messages` as `view()`, the recorded keys, and the spent usage. Neither path throws.

## Patterns

### Bounding any provider call

`ProviderInterface.generate` / `.stream` take a plain `AbortSignal`, so fold an [abort](abort.md), a [timeout](timeout.md), and a token [budget](budget.md) into one bound through `AbortSignal.any` — whichever trips first cancels the call. This works for any provider. A provider built on `AgentProvider` arms its own deadline as well (`AgentProviderInput.timeout`, `DEFAULT_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT` when omitted) and folds it with the signal you pass, so the bound here is the caller's ceiling and the engine's deadline is the backend's — pass a tighter signal to shorten a call, and construct the provider with a tighter `timeout` to shorten every call it makes.

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAbort } from '@orkestrel/abort'
import { createTimeout } from '@orkestrel/timeout'
import { createTokenBudget } from '@orkestrel/budget'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface // any concrete implementation supplied by the host app
const messages = [{ id: '1', role: 'user', content: 'Say hello.' }] as const
const abort = createAbort() // external cancel
const timeout = createTimeout({ ms: 30_000 }) // wall-clock deadline
const budget = createTokenBudget({ max: 50_000, scope: 'total' }) // cost ceiling
timeout.start()
budget.start()

const bound = AbortSignal.any([abort.signal, timeout.signal, budget.signal])
const result = await provider.generate(messages, bound)
budget.consume(result.usage ?? { prompt: 0, completion: 0, total: 0 })
```

### Writing a provider for a new wire

Reach a backend this package has never heard of by extending `AgentProvider` rather than implementing `ProviderInterface` from nothing. The base already holds the deadline, the transport, the `headers` hook, the request, the bounded error read, the decode loop, reasoning separation, and result assembly (the provider-engine clause), so a subclass is the wire and nothing else: `name` identifies the backend, `frame` returns fresh framing state for the call, `body` projects a `ProviderRequest` onto the vendor's request shape, `read` turns one framed record into a `ProviderIncrement`, and `finish` hands back whatever the parser still held at end of input. Pass the vendor's endpoint through `super`, and set `split` and `strict` to match what the wire actually delivers. The fence writes `AgentProvider<string>` because this wire frames nothing: each decoded chunk is one raw-text record, so `TRecord` is `string`. A wire that frames JSON objects extends bare `AgentProvider` and takes the default record type, and a wire with its own record type names that type instead.

```ts
import type {
	ProviderIncrement,
	ProviderOptions,
	ProviderParserInterface,
	ProviderRequest,
} from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { AgentProvider } from '@orkestrel/agent'

class TextFrame implements ProviderParserInterface<string> {
	parse(chunk: string): readonly string[] {
		return [chunk]
	}
	clear(): void {} // Raw text retains no framing state.
}

interface TextOptions extends ProviderOptions {
	readonly url: string
}

class TextProvider extends AgentProvider<string> {
	readonly name = 'text'
	constructor(options: TextOptions) {
		super({ ...options, path: '/generate' })
	}
	frame(): ProviderParserInterface<string> {
		return new TextFrame()
	}
	body(request: ProviderRequest): object {
		return { messages: request.messages }
	}
	read(record: string): ProviderIncrement {
		return { content: record, thinking: '', tools: [] }
	}
	finish(_parser: ProviderParserInterface<string>): readonly string[] {
		return [] // Raw text retains no records at end of input.
	}
}
```

That provider drives the whole runtime unchanged — `createAgent`, the tool loop, the authority gate, and durable jobs all read it through `ProviderInterface`. Take the switches deliberately. Leave `split` at its default when the backend inlines its reasoning as `<think>` spans in the answer, and set `split: false` when the backend already separates reasoning onto its own field, because splitting twice re-classifies text the backend has already ruled on. Set `strict: true` when the protocol always ends with a settled record and a stream that stops short is a protocol failure worth reporting; leave it `false` when the answer is assembled from the deltas themselves.

### Asking a System One server a choice, a noul, and a score

Ask every question about one state in one request, and read each answer with the `computeReading` function. The `SystemOneJudge` class speaks the System One decision protocol. Its wire was recorded against Ollama 0.40.0 serving the `tev1:0.8b` model on 2026-10-07, and it decodes the llama.cpp server's array form and the extra members of Mica's `typesafe_server.py` script as their sources document them. Point the `url` option at the server origin; the wire appends the `SYSTEM_ONE_PATH` constant and fills the request's `model` member from the judge's configured model.

```ts
import { computeReading, createSystemOneJudge } from '@orkestrel/agent'

const judge = createSystemOneJudge({ url: 'http://localhost:11434', model: 'tev1:0.8b' })
const result = await judge.ask(
	{
		state: 'Our checkout has returned 500 errors since 9am. I want a refund for today.',
		questions: {
			label: {
				form: 'choice',
				instructions: 'Which label fits this ticket?',
				criteria: { billing: 'Payments and refunds', bug: 'Software errors', account: null },
			},
			refund: {
				form: 'noul',
				instructions: 'Does the customer ask for money back?',
				criteria: {
					true: 'The customer asks for a refund or for money back.',
					false: 'The customer does not ask for money back.',
				},
			},
			severity: {
				form: 'score',
				instructions: 'How severe is the reported issue?',
				criteria: ['Cosmetic; no impact', 'Degraded, workaround exists', 'Blocking; no workaround'],
			},
		},
	},
	AbortSignal.timeout(30_000),
)
const readings = Object.fromEntries(
	Object.entries(result.answers).map(([id, answer]) => [id, computeReading(answer)]),
)
result.model // 'tev1:0.8b' — the model the server named

```

The values in the comments are the readings of the response Ollama 0.40.0 returned for this request on 2026-10-07. That same response carried the server's own measures, and the wire drops them: a `confidence` of 0.8718 for `label` and 0.7864 for `severity`, where the published formulas read 0.9536 and 0.9241. The servers disagree on those formulas: Ollama reports an entropy measure, Mica's server reports the greatest probability as its `confidence` and the most likely level as its `score`, and Jev reports the published ratio. The stored `probabilities` and `noul` mean the same on every server, so the `computeReading` function derives each measure locally and every server reads on one scale. A `choice` member repeats the most likely option and a `legend` member repeats the question's criteria, so the wire drops both as well (the System One wire clause).

A server that takes a key receives it through the `headers` hook, which each call awaits inside its own deadline (the header-hook authentication clause). TypeSafe Jev takes a bearer key:

```ts
import { createSystemOneJudge } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const key: string // the TypeSafe API key, read from the host's secret store

const jev = createSystemOneJudge({
	url: 'https://api.typesafe.ai',
	model: 'jev-latest',
	headers: () => ({ authorization: `Bearer ${key}` }), // awaited inside each call's deadline
})
```

The executed transcription in [`tests/guides.test.ts`](../tests/guides.test.ts) serves the recorded Ollama response from a loopback `@orkestrel/server` listener and points the first fence's `url` option at that listener in place of `http://localhost:11434`, and it supplies a recording `fetch` transport to the second fence in place of the network. It also decodes the same distribution in the llama.cpp array form and with Mica's server measures, both transliterated from that recording, and reads the same answers from all three.

### Writing a judge wire

Reach a decision server this package does not speak by extending `AgentJudge` rather than implementing `JudgeInterface` from nothing. The engine already holds each call's deadline, the transport, the `headers` hook, the validation before inference, the bounded error read, and the merge of the calls (the batch-switch clause), so a subclass is the wire and nothing else: `name` identifies it, `body` projects one call's `JudgeRequest` onto the server's request shape, and `read` decodes one call's parsed response into a `JudgeResult`. This server reads one question per call, so the fence sets `batch: false`.

```ts
import type { JudgeRequest, JudgeResult } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { AgentJudge, JudgeError } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { isFiniteNumber, isRecord } from '@orkestrel/contract'

// A wire whose server answers one yes/no question per call as { "yes": 0.93 }.
class YesJudge extends AgentJudge {
	readonly name = 'yes'
	body(request: JudgeRequest): object {
		return { model: this.model, state: request.state, questions: request.questions }
	}
	read(value: unknown, request: JudgeRequest): JudgeResult {
		const [id] = Object.keys(request.questions)
		if (id === undefined || !isRecord(value) || !isFiniteNumber(value.yes)) {
			throw new JudgeError('PROTOCOL', 'judge error: unreadable answer')
		}
		return { model: this.model, answers: { [id]: { form: 'noul', noul: value.yes } } }
	}
}

const judge = new YesJudge({
	url: 'http://localhost:8010',
	path: '/v1/yes',
	model: 'yes-1',
	batch: false,
})
```

That judge answers through `ask` like any other. With `batch: false` the engine makes one call per question in key order, each carrying the shared `state` and one question, and merges their answers into one `JudgeResult`. Throw `JudgeError` with code `PROTOCOL` from `read` for a response the wire cannot read; the engine passes it to the caller unchanged. Throw `JudgeError` with code `QUESTION` from `body` for a question the protocol cannot carry; the engine builds every body before the first call, so that refusal lands before any inference. A wire that reads candidates out of a model's own output and cannot find one returns a `Refusal` under `refusals`, listing the caller's keys it could not read, instead of inventing a probability.

### Relaying a browser provider through your own server

When you compose `createAgent(browser, { tools })` in the page, the agent dispatches page tools there after the Node provider returns a tool call. The Node server runs the relay handler and upstream inference. See [Placement proofs](#placement-proofs) for the planned Chromium receipt; the executed transcription described next proves an HTTP hop in Node.

A browser must never hold a model credential. Mount `createRelay` on your own server, where the credential already lives, and give the browser `createRelayProvider` pointed at that route: the browser drives a `ProviderInterface` like any other, and the credential never leaves the server. The handler is a plain `(request: Request) => Promise<Response>`, so any fetch-standard router mounts it — this composition mounts it on an `@orkestrel/router` dispatcher. Each half that follows runs in its own process: copy the server half into your server and the browser half into your browser bundle.

The `@orkestrel/agent` package declares no dependency on a newline-delimited JSON parser, and no runtime dependency on a router or on a server adapter, so the browser application supplies the parser — `createNDJSONParser` from `@orkestrel/ndjson` here — and the server application supplies the router and the adapter. The `@orkestrel/router` and `@orkestrel/server` development dependencies this package declares serve the executed transcription of these fences in [`tests/guides.test.ts`](../tests/guides.test.ts). That transcription runs the server half and the browser half for real: it mounts the relay handler on the dispatcher route the server half declares, starts `@orkestrel/server` on a loopback listener, and drives the browser half against that listener over an HTTP hop in Node. The hop proves the round trip returning the upstream's settled result, the `405` with its `Allow: POST` header a `GET` to `/relay` answers, the `404` a `POST` to another path answers, the `401` a wrong bearer answers with the upstream provider unentered, and the upstream turn a disconnected reader cancels through the adapter's abort of the inbound request.

The transcription substitutes where a test process differs from a deployment. The fence's `declare` placeholders become a scripted upstream provider and a fictional bearer, and the `messages` binding is typed as `readonly Message[]` rather than narrowed with `as const`. It frames the relay response with a parser from this repository's own test infrastructure, which throws on a malformed line where the published parser skips it. It adds `host: '127.0.0.1'` to the `createServer` call, because a test listener binds loopback where a deployed server binds every interface. It points the browser half's `url` option at that address and the port `await server.start()` resolved, in place of the fence's fixed public URL. It closes each case with `await server.stop()` — the fence's own call — rather than the `SIGTERM` listener, which a test process outlives. The byte-limit refusal stays a direct handler call. The `limit` option of the `createRelay` factory caps the body the relay reads, and the `limit` option of the `createServer` factory caps the `body()` read a middleware context makes. This composition registers no middleware, so the server's cap never sees these bytes.

#### Mounting the relay on your server

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createRelay } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createDispatcher } from '@orkestrel/router'
import { createServer } from '@orkestrel/server'

declare const upstream: ProviderInterface // the server-side provider holding the credential
declare const bearer: string

const handler = createRelay({
	provider: upstream,
	authorize: (request) => request.headers.get('authorization') === `Bearer ${bearer}`,
})
const dispatcher = createDispatcher({
	routes: [{ method: 'POST', path: '/relay', handler }],
})

export function serve(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
	return dispatcher.handle(request, undefined)
}

const server = createServer({ dispatcher, state: () => undefined })
await server.start()
process.on('SIGTERM', () => server.stop()) // signal cancellation, drain, then close the listener
```

The `serve` function is the entry a server runtime's adapter calls, and the adapter owns what the relay deliberately does not: turning the runtime's inbound request into a `Request`, handing the returned `Response` back to the runtime, and aborting that request's signal when the client disconnects, so a reader that goes away cancels the upstream turn instead of leaving it running. `@orkestrel/server` supplies that adapter — `createServer` binds the same `dispatcher` and starts listening, as the fence shows — and a runtime whose own handler is already `(request: Request) => Promise<Response>` needs none.

#### Reaching the relay from the browser

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createRelayProvider } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAbort } from '@orkestrel/abort'
// The browser application supplies this parser dependency.
import { createNDJSONParser } from '@orkestrel/ndjson'

declare const bearer: string
const abort = createAbort()
const messages = [{ id: '1', role: 'user', content: 'Say hello.' }] as const

const browser: ProviderInterface = createRelayProvider({
	url: 'https://app.example/relay',
	parser: createNDJSONParser,
	headers: () => ({ authorization: `Bearer ${bearer}` }),
})
const result = await browser.generate(messages, abort.signal) // a ProviderResult like a local provider's
```

`authorize` is mandatory and carries obligations the mechanism deliberately does not assume for you: it must not read the request body, and it performs no origin or method check of its own, so an application that authorizes on an ambient credential such as a cookie composes origin and CSRF middleware in front of the handler. A bearer header the browser sets explicitly, as here, is not reachable cross-site. Every refusal — `401` for a failed authorization, `413` for a body that reaches the byte limit, `400` for a missing, unreadable, or rejected body, `502` for an upstream call that cannot be constructed — arrives at the browser as a `ProviderError` with code `'HTTP'` and that status. The `401`, `400`, and `413` refusals leave the upstream provider unentered; the `502` is answered after `provider.stream` was entered and threw before returning its iterator, so that refusal has already reached the provider. An upstream failure that does happen mid-stream reaches the browser as the fixed `RELAY_PROVIDER_MESSAGE` text, never the upstream's own message (the relay-protocol clause).

### Dispatching the model's tool calls

Advertising and dispatch are the halves of one exchange: hand `definitions()` to the provider, and feed the `ToolCall`s that come back through `execute`. Results are correlated by `id` and discriminated on `success`, so a handler throw arrives as a `ToolResult` the model can read rather than an exception the caller must catch.

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createToolManager, createTool } from '@orkestrel/tool'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface
const tools = createToolManager()
tools.add(createTool({ name: 'add', execute: (args) => Number(args.a) + Number(args.b) }))

const turn = await provider.generate(messages, signal, tools.definitions())
if (turn.tools) {
	const results = await tools.execute(turn.tools) // each correlated by id; one bad call never fails the batch
	// feed `results` back as the next turn's tool messages
}
```

### Running the loop (instead of driving the provider by hand)

The preceding patterns are what an `Agent` does for you turn after turn — bounding the call, dispatching the model's tools, feeding the results back, and repeating until the model stops (or `limit` is hit). Reach for `createAgent` rather than hand-rolling the loop; bound and pace it through `AgentOptions`, and recover a cancel's partial from `result` (which resolves, never rejects, on a cancel).

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAgent } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface
const agent = createAgent(provider, { timeout: 30_000, limit: 6 })
agent.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Summarize the news.' })

// Cancel from elsewhere — the turn commits whatever streamed so far.
setTimeout(() => agent.abort('user navigated away'), 5_000)

const result = await agent.generate()
if (result.partial) keep(result.content) // a cancel RESOLVED partial, not an error
```

### Cancelling work inside a tool

Every handler receives `(args, context)`, with the run's bound signal at `context.signal`; handlers may omit unused parameters. The agent passes this context through the authority and no-authority dispatch branches and supplies no `caller` identity. An agent abort, a stream abort, an external signal, or the deadline can abort a running handler's signal. The token budget is charged during provider streaming and between turns, before tool dispatch; exhaustion ends the run without dispatching, never inside a handler.

When the signal has aborted before the tool block, the agent leaves the prior conversation intact: it appends neither an assistant turn carrying calls nor tool messages and emits no `tool` chunk. The streamed content remains in the result, which settles with `partial: true`. After dispatch begins, cancellation is cooperative: the handler must stop its own work, and the agent waits for a handler that ignores the signal, records its real result, and then settles the run with `partial: true`. A cancelled run runs no automatic compaction after dispatch; the next run's pre-first-turn check folds instead.

This fence uses a provider that requests the `wait` tool. The handler resolves from its abort listener, and the run commits the partial result:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAgent } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createTool, createToolManager } from '@orkestrel/tool'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface // requests the wait tool
const entered = Promise.withResolvers<void>()
const cancelled = Promise.withResolvers<boolean>()
const tools = createToolManager()
tools.add(
	createTool({
		name: 'wait',
		execute: (_args, context) => {
			context.signal.addEventListener(
				'abort',
				() => {
					cancelled.resolve(context.signal.aborted)
				},
				{ once: true },
			)
			entered.resolve()
			return cancelled.promise
		},
	}),
)
const agent = createAgent(provider, { tools })
const stream = agent.stream()
await entered.promise
agent.abort('request ended')
await cancelled.promise // true — observed inside the handler
const result = await stream.result
result.partial // true
```

The executed transcription in [`tests/guides.test.ts`](../tests/guides.test.ts), “observes cancellation inside the handler as the tool cancellation fence claims”, supplies the scripted provider and asserts those values.

### Bounding cost mid-stream (the token `budget`)

An `AgentOptions.budget` (or a per-run override) is not only charged from each turn's final reported `usage` — the loop also charges it incrementally, mid-stream, from an estimated token count as content deltas arrive (the `estimateTokens` `ceil(length / 4)` heuristic), so a runaway completion trips the ceiling without waiting for the turn to finish. When the mid-stream estimate crosses the budget, the budget's `signal` fires, folding into the run's bound abort exactly like an external cancel or a `timeout` — the provider is cancelled, and the run resolves `partial: true` with an `abort` event (the same funnel as any other cancel).

After a turn completes, the loop reconciles: it charges the budget the remainder of the turn's authoritative `usage` (`completion - alreadyCharged`, `total - alreadyCharged`, plus the full `prompt` — which is never estimated mid-stream, having no live delta channel) — so the turn's total budget draw always nets to exactly the reported usage, never double-charged and never under-charged. The `AgentResult.usage` / the `usage` chunks you observe stay the full authoritative usage regardless — this reconcile affects only what the `budget` itself was charged, never what you're told the turn cost. This mid-stream enforcement is bounded, not exact — the estimate can under- or over-shoot the eventual real usage by a turn's tail, so treat the `budget.max` as a firm ceiling with some slack, not a byte-exact cutoff.

```ts
import { createAgent } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createTokenBudget } from '@orkestrel/budget'

const budget = createTokenBudget({ max: 2_000, scope: 'completion' })
const agent = createAgent(provider, { budget })
agent.emitter.on('abort', (reason) => log('budget tripped mid-stream', reason))
agent.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Write a very long story.' })
const result = await agent.generate() // partial: true if the story ran the budget out mid-stream
```

**A `think: true` run needs headroom for reasoning.** Live reasoning deltas (`ProviderDelta` `'thinking'`) are not metered mid-stream (only `'content'` deltas are — thinking is charged, like content, solely through the post-turn reconcile), so a thinking model can spend a large share of a tight budget's ceiling on its reasoning before any answer content streams — the mid-stream trip can land while the model is still reasoning, committing an empty (or near-empty) `content` alongside `partial: true`. Give a `think: true` run enough budget headroom to cover its reasoning, not only its expected answer length.

### Observing an agent (push vs. pull)

An `Agent` exposes a pull and a push observation surface. Pull — the `AgentChunk` stream (`stream().events`) — is for a live consumer rendering per-token answer deltas and per-think reasoning deltas as they arrive. Push — the `emitter` (`AgentEventMap`) — is for fire-and-forget observers (logging, metrics, tracing) that want the loop's lifecycle moments without draining the stream: `start` (a run begins), `turn` (each iteration), `tool` (a dispatched call + its result), `usage` (a turn's token usage), `deny` (an authority denial — which never reaches the chunk stream), `finish` (the settled result), `error` (a genuine failure), `abort` (a cancel), and `exhaust` (the limit was reached while the model still held unresolved tool intent — fires instead of `abort`, still followed by `finish`). Per-token / per-thinking deltas stay the stream's job exclusively — there is deliberately no `token` or `think` event on the emitter; reach for the stream when you need live output, the emitter when you need lifecycle.

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAgent } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface
// Wire fire-and-forget observers at construction through the reserved `on` option …
const agent = createAgent(provider, {
	on: {
		start: (id) => trace.begin(id),
		usage: (usage) => meter.add(usage.total),
		deny: (call, reason) => audit(call.name, reason), // not visible on the chunk stream
		finish: (result) => trace.end(result),
	},
})
// … or subscribe later through `agent.emitter`.
agent.emitter.on('abort', (reason) => log('cancelled', reason))
```

**Observation can never corrupt the loop.** The emitter isolates a listener that throws (the throw can never escape into the settle-once / wake-park engine — `generate()` / `stream()` still settle the exact same result), routing the caught error to its own `error` handler (the `error` option, surfaced as `(error, event)`, not a domain event) so the observer bug is not silently lost. Every throwing listener surfaces (not only the first); a throwing `error` handler is swallowed too (it can neither recurse nor escape); with no handler the throw is dropped silently. So a buggy observer degrades to a routed error — it never reorders, throws into, or corrupts the run.

**A cancelled run emits `abort` then `finish`.** A cancel (an external `signal`, the `timeout` deadline, an exhausted `budget`, or `abort()`) still resolves a partial result — so the emitter fires `abort` (carrying the cancel reason) and then `finish` (carrying the settled partial), letting an observer see both that the run was cancelled and the partial outcome it committed. A natural / cap-bounded finish fires `finish` only; a genuine provider / tool error fires `error` instead of `finish`. `generate()` and `stream()` drive the same events (they share one `#run`).

### Pulling context from another conversation (with provenance)

One agent serves many conversations by switching the active conversation between runs (`conversations.switch(id)` — the active-conversation clause); each thread keeps its own history. When the active conversation A needs something decided in another conversation B, do not merge B's turns into A's live tail — that pollutes A's thread and (for a small model) blurs which conversation said what. Instead pull a provenance-labeled reference of B into A's active workspace (the fenced reference channel `build()` folds into the system block), so the model reads it as clearly-foreign material and attributes it to B.

The flow is **summary → search / rehydrate → reference → write-to-workspace** — and cherry-pick, never dump:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAgent, createConversationManager } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface
const conversations = createConversationManager({
	summarize: /* a ConversationSummaryHandler */ undefined,
	rollup: true, // keep a rollup summary per thread for the relevance check
})
const a = conversations.add({ id: 'auth' }) // the ACTIVE thread (the first add auto-activates it)
const b = conversations.add({ id: 'planning' }) // the OTHER thread to pull from

const agent = createAgent(provider, { conversations }) // its active conversation (a) is the message source

// 1. summary → decide B is relevant (its rollup is a cheap digest of the whole thread)
b.summary // for example "the team evaluated databases and chose Postgres"
// 2. search / rehydrate → SELECT the few right turns (never B's whole history)
const picked = b.search('database') // or b.rehydrate(sectionId) for a compacted slice
// 3. reference → FRAME them as a self-labeled provenance block (a pure string, no model call)
const block = b.reference({ label: 'planning', messages: picked })
// 4. write-to-workspace → into the ACTIVE conversation's context active workspace, keyed by the source id
agent.context.workspaces.add().write(`conversation:${b.id}.md`, block)

// The model can then use B's decision AND attribute it: "Postgres, decided in the planning conversation."
```

Why this shape: `reference()` leads with `[Reference — conversation "<label>" — NOT part of this conversation]`, so the model treats the rollup + excerpts as a quoted foreign source (it answers "decided in the planning conversation", not "we decided here"). Keep the excerpts cherry-picked — this content enters another context window a small model must read, and a full dump re-bloats it. `reference()` is event-free and never calls a model; provenance lives in the `label` (default the conversation's `id`).

**Within a conversation, the same provenance instinct applies to recaps.** `view()` folds each compacted section into a synthetic `assistant` recap — and prefixes it with `CONVERSATION_RECAP_PREFIX` (`[Summary of earlier messages] …`) so a small model reads it as a condensed recap of earlier turns rather than a literal turn to echo or treat as the live answer. The label is deliberately lean (a fixed handful of tokens — no per-section blow-up) and is a `view()`-only presentation concern (the rollup regeneration re-reads the unframed summaries). Empirically, on a 2B model this tightening is the difference between the model correctly attributing a recapped fact and mis-attributing it — at temperature 0 the recap label reliably steers correct attribution where the bare assistant turn does not.

### Persisting a conversation through either store

A conversation snapshot carries its generated identity, so the same `set` / `get` / `delete` workflow works through the in-memory store and the driver-backed store without hard-coding an id:

```ts
import {
	createConversation,
	createDatabaseConversationStore,
	createMemoryConversationStore,
} from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createMemoryDriver } from '@orkestrel/database'

const conversation = createConversation()
conversation.add({ role: 'user', content: 'hello' })
const snapshot = conversation.snapshot()
const stores = [
	createMemoryConversationStore(),
	createDatabaseConversationStore(createMemoryDriver()),
]

for (const store of stores) {
	await store.set(snapshot)
	const stored = await store.get(conversation.id)
	JSON.stringify(stored) === JSON.stringify(snapshot) // true
	await store.delete(conversation.id)
	await store.get(conversation.id) // undefined
}
```

### Recording a judgment on a conversation

A conversation carries its own judgment store, so a judge's answer about a message is recorded beside the messages it concerns and survives the snapshot round trip. `add` stamps the record's `time`; `judgment` reads one record by its key and `judgments` lists them in insertion order.

```ts
import { createConversation } from '@orkestrel/agent'

const conversation = createConversation()
const complaint = conversation.add({ role: 'user', content: 'I was charged twice for one order.' })

conversation.judgments.add({
	id: 'refund',
	question: { form: 'noul', instructions: 'Is a refund owed?' },
	answer: { form: 'noul', noul: 0.9 },
	model: 'tev1:0.8b',
	sources: [complaint.id],
	state: complaint.content,
})

const refund = conversation.judgments.judgment('refund')
const recorded = conversation.judgments.judgments()
const snapshot = conversation.snapshot()
```

### Running many durable agents as jobs

When you need many agents — bounded, retried, surviving a crash — describe each as a serializable `AgentJobInput` (names for the live pieces, data for the rest), register the live pieces once, and run them through a `createAgentQueue` (durable, bounded) or a `createAgentRunner` (one-shot, ordered, fail-fast, with sub-agent fan-out). The layer composes the `@orkestrel/queue` `Queue` and the `@orkestrel/workflow` `Runner` — it adds only rehydration and the partial policy, no engine of its own.

```ts
import type { AgentJobInput } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAgentQueue, createAgentRegistry } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createMemoryQueueStore } from '@orkestrel/queue'

declare const store: ReturnType<typeof createMemoryQueueStore> // or a server JSON / SQLite store

// Register the live, non-serializable pieces ONCE; jobs reference them by name.
const registry = createAgentRegistry({ providers: { main: provider } })
const queue = createAgentQueue({ registry, concurrency: 4, retries: 1, store })

const jobs: readonly AgentJobInput[] = [
	{ provider: 'main', messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Summarize doc A.' }] },
	{ provider: 'main', messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Summarize doc B.' }], budget: 50_000 },
]
const results = await Promise.all(jobs.map((job) => queue.enqueue(job)))

// After a crash, re-run whatever was still outstanding — the registry rehydrates them.
await queue.restore()
```

Fan out sub-agents by declaring `children` on a parent job; `createAgentRunner` `controller.spawn`s each through the same bounded queue, so the children run as sibling sub-agents:

```ts
import { createAgentRunner } from '@orkestrel/agent'

const runner = createAgentRunner({ registry, concurrency: 4 })
const parent: AgentJobInput = {
	provider: 'main',
	messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Plan the trip.' }],
	children: [{ provider: 'main', messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Find flights.' }] }],
}
const results = await runner.execute([parent]) // [parent result, …then spawned child results]
```

### Giving the model documents to read

A workspace reaches the model through `context.workspaces`, and this is the only channel documents have. `build()` renders the active workspace by carrier on every turn — active-only and scope-filtered — so the workspace the agent is working in is always what the prompt reflects, with nothing to re-mount after an edit. Register one (the first `add` auto-activates it) and its text files fold into the `## Workspace` system section as fenced reference blocks, while its image files' base64 rides the last user message.

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAgent } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createToolManager } from '@orkestrel/tool'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface
const agent = createAgent(provider, { tools: createToolManager() })

// The first add auto-activates — agent.context.workspaces.active is this workspace, so build()
// renders its text files into the `## Workspace` section on every turn.
const workspace = agent.context.workspaces.add()
workspace.write('briefing.txt', 'The vault code is 7731.')
```

Reading is one half. To let the model edit what it reads, register the `createWorkspaceTool` published by `@orkestrel/toolbox` on `agent.context.tools` over this same `context.workspaces` registry: an `operation`-keyed `ToolInterface` whose dispatch and error semantics are that package's to document. The surfaces then close a loop — the model reads the workspace from the prompt, edits it through a tool call, and reads the edited version on the next turn.

### Switching which workspace the model sees

Only the active workspace renders; the other registered workspaces never reach the model at all. `switch` changes which one the model sees between runs:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAgent, createScope } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface
const agent = createAgent(provider)

const project = agent.context.workspaces.add() // auto-activates
project.write('src/config.ts', 'export const PORT = 8123')

agent.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'What port is configured?' })
await agent.generate() // the model reads the active workspace's file from the prompt

// Serve a different workspace next run — switch the active pointer:
const other = agent.context.workspaces.add() // NOT active (a later add leaves active unchanged)
other.write('notes.txt', 'different context')
agent.context.workspaces.switch(other.id) // build() renders other's files from here
// Narrow which files render with scope.files (by path):
agent.context.apply(createScope({ name: 'cfg', files: ['src/config.ts'] }))
```

A switch between runs changes the files the next run's prompt carries, and `scope.files` then filters the switched workspace's files by path.

### Switching modes with a scope

A mode is a scope an application keeps ready: its allow-lists, a `description` for the page that shows it, and an optional `select` handler. Load the data from a plain file, and attach each handler in code through a guarded lookup, because a file carries no function. Switch modes with `context.apply`; each change applies at the sites [Scoping a turn](#scoping-a-turn) names.

`mode.narrow({ tools: [] })` is the answer mode that keeps the mode's handler, because `narrow` keeps the parent's `name`, `description`, and `select`. `apply(undefined)` and a plain answer scope with no handler fall back to the agent default. A mode that must run with no selection under a default carries a pass-through handler that returns `view()`; the package exports no such handler.

The following modes load from data, attach their handlers in code, and switch between runs:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface, ScopeInterface, SelectionHandler } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import type { ToolManagerInterface } from '@orkestrel/tool'
import { createAgent, createScope } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface
declare const tools: ToolManagerInterface // holds the `lookup` tool
declare const judged: SelectionHandler // the agent default, such as a createSelection handler
declare const recent: SelectionHandler // the triage mode's own policy

// Plain data, as a JSON file holds it; the data names a policy because a file carries no function.
const MODES = [
	{ name: 'triage', description: 'Sort the ticket.', tools: ['lookup'], policy: 'recent' },
	{ name: 'verbatim', description: 'Quote the thread unchanged.', tools: [], policy: 'none' },
]
const POLICIES: Readonly<Record<string, SelectionHandler>> = {
	recent,
	// No selection under the judging default: a pass-through handler returns view().
	none: async (conversation) => ({ messages: conversation.view(), judgments: [] }),
}
const modes = new Map<string, ScopeInterface>()
for (const { policy, ...data } of MODES) {
	const select = POLICIES[policy]
	modes.set(data.name, createScope(select === undefined ? data : { ...data, select }))
}

const agent = createAgent(provider, { tools, select: judged })
async function ask(content: string): Promise<void> {
	agent.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content })
	await agent.generate()
}

const triage = modes.get('triage')
agent.context.apply(triage)
await ask('Sort ticket 7.') // `recent` selects; `lookup` is advertised
agent.context.apply(triage?.narrow({ tools: [] }))
await ask('Answer from what you have.') // `recent` selects; no tool is advertised
agent.context.apply(createScope({ name: 'answer', tools: [] }))
await ask('Answer briefly.') // `judged` selects
agent.context.apply(undefined)
await ask('Close ticket 7.') // `judged` selects

// A one-run mode: apply, generate, and restore after the result settles.
const previous = agent.context.scope
agent.context.apply(modes.get('verbatim'))
try {
	await ask('Quote the thread.') // the pass-through selects; `judged` is not called
} finally {
	agent.context.apply(previous)
}
```

Overlapping runs on one agent share its scope and its default handler, so an `apply` made for one run reaches every run in flight at its next site. Runs that need different modes at the same moment need separate agents.

### Answering without tools

When the next turn must answer from what it already holds, apply a scope with an empty `tools` list: `createScope({ name: 'answer', tools: [] })`. The package exports no constant for it. The provider's `content` ends the run as the answer with `partial: false`, and each call the reply still carries emits `deny` with the reason `no tool is advertised in the active scope`, as [Scoping a turn](#scoping-a-turn) states. That reason and `TOOL is not in the active scope` are frozen copy, so a harness can match them verbatim.

The following run ends answer-only:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createAgent, createScope } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createTool, createToolManager } from '@orkestrel/tool'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface // replies with text and a stray `refund` call
declare function log(name: string, reason: string | undefined): void

const tools = createToolManager()
tools.add(createTool({ name: 'refund', execute: () => 'refunded' }))
const agent = createAgent(provider, { tools })
agent.emitter.on('deny', (call, reason) => log(call.name, reason)) // 'refund', 'no tool is advertised in the active scope'
agent.context.apply(createScope({ name: 'answer', tools: [] }))
agent.context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Refund invoice 42.' })
const result = await agent.generate() // { content: 'Refunds need a manager.', partial: false }
```

### Selecting the prompt with a judge

Install `createSelection` on `AgentOptions.select` to make a judge the agent's default policy, and read each `select` receipt beside the active scope's `description` to show what the prompt carried and in which mode. The receipt's `judgments` name records in the active conversation's `judgments` store, and its `usage` is the judge cost the run already charged.

The following agent shows each receipt beside its mode's description:

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface, ScreenHandler } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import {
	createAgent,
	createScope,
	createSelection,
	createSystemOneJudge,
	NEEDED_CRITERION,
} from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface
declare const threshold: number // the application's cutoff: above 0.5 and at most 1
declare const limit: number // the fresh questions one selection may ask
declare function show(description: string | undefined, kept: number, judged: number): void

const judge = createSystemOneJudge({ url: 'http://localhost:11434', model: 'tev1:0.8b' })
const screen: ScreenHandler = (conversation) =>
	conversation
		.view()
		.filter((message) => message.role === 'user')
		.map((message) => message.id)
const agent = createAgent(provider, {
	select: createSelection({ judge, screen, needed: { ...NEEDED_CRITERION, threshold }, limit }),
})
agent.context.apply(createScope({ name: 'reply', description: 'Answer from the ticket thread.' }))
agent.emitter.on('select', (selection) =>
	show(agent.context.scope?.description, selection.messages.length, selection.judgments.length),
)
agent.context.messages.add([
	{ role: 'user', content: 'Use only local files; do not access the internet.' },
	{ role: 'user', content: 'The office printer needs paper.' },
	{ role: 'user', content: 'Export the active accounts from the local database.' },
])
await agent.generate() // show('Answer from the ticket thread.', 2, 2) — the printer note is dropped
```

As in [The stock selection](#the-stock-selection), the executed transcription serves recorded probabilities from a loopback listener and supplies the cutoff and the limit.

### Serving requests through a ledger

Build a ledger from a provider, a judge, the lookups, and the measured questions, add the seed history to its conversation, and send each request through the `respond` method. Read the `briefing` member of each `select` event's receipt to see what the ledger told the model. The following ledger serves two requests; a scripted provider stands in for the model and a scripted judge for Mica:

```ts
import type {
	JudgeAnswer,
	JudgeInterface,
	LedgerLookup,
	LedgerThreshold,
	ProviderInterface,
	ProviderResult,
} from '@orkestrel/agent'
import { createLedger, LEDGER_QUESTIONS } from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const thresholds: LedgerThreshold // fitted on LEDGER_QUESTIONS and your judge

// Each provider call takes the next reply: two calibration calls, then one reply per turn.
const replies: ProviderResult[] = [
	{ content: '', usage: { prompt: 160, completion: 0, total: 160 } }, // calibration with the tools
	{ content: '', usage: { prompt: 40, completion: 0, total: 40 } }, // calibration without them
	{ content: '', tools: [{ id: 'call-1', name: 'lookup_order', arguments: { id: 'BW-5512' } }] },
	{ content: 'Order BW-5512 qualifies for a $148.50 refund.' },
	{ content: 'Yes. Refunds over $100 need a manager.' },
]
const provider: ProviderInterface = {
	id: 'scripted',
	name: 'scripted',
	generate: async () => replies.shift() ?? { content: '' },
	async *stream() {
		const reply = replies.shift() ?? { content: '' }
		if (reply.content !== '') yield { channel: 'content', text: reply.content }
		return reply
	},
}
// The judge files every message it categorizes as a rule and answers no to every noul question.
const judge: JudgeInterface = {
	id: 'scripted',
	name: 'scripted',
	model: 'scripted',
	ask: async (request) => {
		const answers: Record<string, JudgeAnswer> = {}
		for (const [id, question] of Object.entries(request.questions)) {
			answers[id] =
				question.form === 'choice'
					? { form: 'choice', probabilities: { rule: 0.9, fact: 0.1 } }
					: { form: 'noul', noul: 0.1 }
		}
		return { model: 'scripted', answers }
	},
}
// One lookup: the tool the model calls and the handler that reads the owner out of its result.
const lookup: LedgerLookup = {
	tool: {
		name: 'lookup_order',
		description: 'Read an order by its id.',
		parameters: { type: 'object', properties: { id: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['id'] },
		execute: (args) =>
			`Order ${String(args.id)} for account BW-20931: Brightwater Studio. Refund due $148.50.`,
	},
	read: (args, text) =>
		text.startsWith('No order')
			? undefined // the lookup found nothing
			: { ids: [String(args.id)], owners: [{ id: 'BW-20931', names: ['Brightwater Studio'] }] },
}

const ledger = createLedger(provider, {
	judge,
	system: 'You staff the Larkspur support desk. Today is 2026-10-09.',
	topics: [{ name: 'refunds', criterion: 'refund amounts and approvals' }],
	questions: LEDGER_QUESTIONS,
	thresholds,
	capacity: 32_768,
	lookups: [lookup],
})
const briefings: Array<string | undefined> = []
ledger.agent.emitter.on('select', (selection) => briefings.push(selection.briefing))
ledger.conversation.add({ role: 'user', content: 'Refunds over $100 need a manager.' })

const gauge = await ledger.calibrate(AbortSignal.timeout(30_000))
gauge.fixed // 120 — what advertising the tools adds to a prompt
const first = await ledger.respond('Can Brightwater Studio get a refund on order BW-5512?')
first.content // 'Order BW-5512 qualifies for a $148.50 refund.'
const second = await ledger.respond('Does the Brightwater Studio refund need a manager?')
second.content // 'Yes. Refunds over $100 need a manager.'
briefings[0] // '## Rules\n- Refunds over $100 need a manager.' — no lookup has named an owner yet
briefings[1]
// '## Pinned\n### Brightwater Studio (account BW-20931)\n- Order BW-5512 for account BW-20931: Brightwater Studio.\n- Refund due $148.50.\n\n## Rules\n- Refunds over $100 need a manager.'
```

The second request names Brightwater Studio, so its briefing pins that owner's record, built from the first request's lookup result, while neither the first request nor its reply reaches the second prompt. The executed transcription runs this fence with its own cutoffs and reads the prompts the provider received; see [the `tests/guides.test.ts` parity test](../tests/guides.test.ts).

### Removing / clearing entries, and the less-common accessors

Agent-owned registries expose their less-common removal, clearing, persistence, and lookup methods here. Tool and workspace registry operations are documented in their dependency guides.

```ts
import type { ProviderInterface } from '@orkestrel/agent'
import {
	createAgent,
	createAgentContext,
	createAgentRegistry,
	createAuthority,
	createConversationManager,
	createInstructionManager,
	createScopeManager,
	createThinkSplitter,
} from '@orkestrel/agent'

declare const provider: ProviderInterface

// ThinkSplitter — one per stream; `split` yields clean content, `flush` settles the end.
const splitter = createThinkSplitter()
splitter.split('hello') // clean content for this raw wire delta
splitter.flush() // any held partial tag / unclosed span resolved at stream end

// The message store (context.messages, a MessageManagerInterface) — same remove / clear.
const context = createAgentContext()
const added = context.messages.add({ role: 'user', content: 'hi' })
context.messages.remove(added.id)
context.messages.clear()

// InstructionManager — same remove / clear.
context.instructions.remove('tone')
context.instructions.clear()

// ScopeManager — `create` mints + stores, `scopes` lists, `remove` / `clear` drop.
const scopes = createScopeManager()
const scope = scopes.create({ name: 'read-only' })
scopes.scopes() // every stored scope, in insertion order
scopes.remove(scope.id)
scopes.clear()

// Authority — `evaluate` is its one method (also reached through the agent loop internally).
const authority = createAuthority()
authority.evaluate({ call: { id: '1', name: 'add', arguments: {} } })

// AgentRegistry — `scheduler(name)` resolves a registered scheduler by name (throws when absent).
const registry = createAgentRegistry({ providers: { main: provider } })
try {
	registry.scheduler('paced') // throws 'unknown scheduler: paced' — none registered here
} catch {
	// expected — this registry has no `schedulers` pool
}

// ConversationManager — `save` persists a registered conversation, `remove` / `clear` drop it.
const conversations = createConversationManager({ summarize: undefined })
const thread = conversations.add({ id: 'thread-1' })
await conversations.save(thread.id)
conversations.remove(thread.id)
conversations.clear()

// Conversation — `remove` one live message, `clear` the live tail, `snapshot` for durability.
const message = thread.add({ role: 'user', content: 'hi' })
thread.remove(message.id)
thread.clear()
thread.snapshot() // { id, summary?, sections, messages, judgments? } — the durable payload

const agent = createAgent(provider)
void agent
```

### Practices

- **Bound every call** — pass an `AbortSignal` (an [abort](abort.md), or an `AbortSignal.any` over abort + [timeout](timeout.md) + [budget](budget.md)) so a request can be cancelled, deadlined, or capped.
- **Recover the stream's partial** — wrap a driven `stream` in `try`/`catch` and narrow with `isProviderAbortError` to keep the content that arrived before a cancel.
- **Fold usage into a budget** — `result.usage` is the [budgets](budget.md) `TokenUsage`; `consume` it per turn to enforce a token ceiling.
- **Register tools in a `ToolManager`** — `add` your `Tool`s, hand `definitions()` to the provider, and dispatch the model's `ToolCall`s through `execute`; read the outcome by narrowing on `success` rather than catching, because a handler's throw already arrives as the failure arm. When in-process code wants a typed error instead, call `tools.tool(name)` and `execute` it directly.
- **Narrow tool `args`** — a `ToolCall.arguments` is model-supplied `unknown`; narrow it inside `execute` with a guard.
- **Collect turns in an `AgentContext`** — `add` to `context.messages` (the `id` is minted for you), then `build()` the provider input each turn; tools travel as the provider's `tools` argument, so never fold a tool's schema into a message yourself.
- **Pull cross-conversation context with provenance, never by merging turns** — to use something from another conversation B in the active one, follow `B.summary` (decide relevance) → `B.search` / `B.rehydrate` (cherry-pick the few right turns) → `B.reference({ label, messages })` (frame it) → `context.workspaces.active?.write(...)` (write it into the active workspace). The provenance label keeps a small model from reading B's content (or a recap) as part of the live thread; cherry-pick — don't dump B's whole history into another context window.
- **Run the loop with `createAgent`** — don't hand-roll the context → provider → tools cycle; `createAgent` does it, bounded by `AbortSignal.any([signal, timeout, budget])`, paced by `scheduler`, capped at `limit`. Drain `stream().events` to render `token` / `think` / `tool` / `usage` chunks live, or `generate()` for the settled result; either way `result` resolves partial on a cancel (read `result.partial`), rejecting only on a real error.
- **Run many durable agents with `createAgentQueue`** — describe each agent as a serializable `AgentJobInput` (names for the provider / tools / authority / scheduler, data for the rest), register the live pieces once in a `createAgentRegistry`, and enqueue the jobs. Persist them with a `store` so `restore()` re-runs outstanding work after a crash. Decide the partial policy up front — `partial: false` (default) retries a cancelled job, `true` accepts the partial.
- **Fan out sub-agents with `createAgentRunner`** — declare a parent job's sub-agents in its `children`; the runner `controller.spawn`s each through the same bounded queue. Don't reach for the controller yourself — express fan-out as data on the job (it stays serializable) and let the runner spawn it.
- **Pull and push surfaces on the `Agent`, none elsewhere** — observe the `Agent` each way: pull the `AgentChunk` stream for per-token / per-thinking deltas + usage/tool chunks, or push `agent.emitter.on(...)` (`AgentEventMap`) for lifecycle + usage/tool/deny moments a fire-and-forget observer wants. A listener throw can never corrupt the loop (the emitter isolates it, routing it to the `error` option). Do not reach for an Emitter on the provider contract, the tool registry, the conversation store, the context, or the job layer — those stay event-free; and do not expect per-token `token` or `think` events (those stay the stream's job).
- **Create and edit files through `@orkestrel/workspace`** — the file domain is that package's, and `AgentContext` borrows only its `isText` / `isBinary` guards to decide a file's carrier. The rendering is agent's: the `## Workspace` fencing and the binary-plus-`image/` attachment are prompt policy that belongs here, not workspace helpers that belong there.
- **Judge the argument the model passed** — a tool handler that asks a judge about a model's tool call judges the argument that call carried, or its tool description says it judges a fixed input.
- **Write a refusal as the next step** — a refusal text a tool returns names the one next call and says nothing about who asked, because a reasoning model mid-task reads a refusal that addresses the user as a user turn.
- **Give the model both halves of a workspace** — `context.workspaces` is what it reads, rendered by carrier every turn, active-only and filtered by `scope.files`; the `createWorkspaceTool` published by `@orkestrel/toolbox` over that same registry is what it writes. Workspace editing, errors, and persistence live in [`workspace.md`](workspace.md); tool dispatch semantics live in [`tool.md`](tool.md).

- [`tests/src/core/ledgers/Ledger.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/ledgers/Ledger.test.ts) — the ledger over a scripted provider: owner records, seed stubs, and the seed tail, the repeat stop, the answer pass and the abort that skips it, calibration and its refusals, the filing of notes and failed lookups, the `recall` tool's limit and room, and stale sentences across the briefing, the tail, `recall`, and the answer digest.
- [`tests/src/core/ledgers/Classifier.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/ledgers/Classifier.test.ts) — the measured question bytes and asking order, judgment reuse and usage, exact cutoffs, pair questions, deterministic and transient judge failures, and abort faults that keep the completed judgments.
- [`tests/src/core/ledgers/Gauge.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/ledgers/Gauge.test.ts) — the gauge's construction refusals and its `measure`, `observe`, `rate`, `left`, `reserve`, and `room` methods.
- [`tests/src/core/ledgers/factories.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/ledgers/factories.test.ts) — `createLedger` and its `LedgerError` refusals for thresholds, shares, capacity, limits, topics, lookups, and a supplied gauge, and the barrel exports of the ledger module.
- [`tests/src/core/ledgers/helpers.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/ledgers/helpers.test.ts) — the projection helpers from `splitSentences` through `buildRecords` and `selectRecords`, the record renderers, `splitTopic`, `cutItems` and `matchesCutLine`, `renderStub`, and `fitSlope`.

### Placement proofs

Each placement has a named proof location:

- **Node alone.** The agent, provider, and tools run in Node. The `src:core` project executes “runs the agent tool loop in Node and feeds the result into the next provider turn” in [`tests/src/core/integration.test.ts`](../tests/src/core/integration.test.ts).
- **Page alone.** The agent, an in-page provider, and page tools run in the page. The receipt is planned in the `@orkestrel/mcp` checkout's `tests/distribution.test.ts` file, in the `distribution` project: the planned proof “executes a page tool through an agent without network requests”. That receipt must come from installed artifacts in Chromium; this guide does not record it as passed.
- **Page to Node relay.** The agent, relay provider, and page tools run in the page; `createRelay` and the upstream provider run in Node. The receipt is planned in the same `@orkestrel/mcp` distribution proof file: the planned proof “executes a page tool through an agent over a Node relay”. This guide does not record that Chromium receipt as passed. The guide transcription's HTTP hop runs in Node and proves that narrower placement.

## See also

- [`budget.md`](budget.md) — the cost primitive; `ProviderResult.usage` and `AgentResult.usage` reuse its `TokenUsage`, and a token budget bounds a provider call / an agent turn.
- [`abort.md`](abort.md) / [`timeout.md`](timeout.md) — the bounding signals folded into a call's `AbortSignal` through `AbortSignal.any`; `@orkestrel/timeout` is also the deadline `AgentProvider` arms for every call it makes.
- `@orkestrel/ndjson` — the newline-delimited JSON parser a relay browser application hands `createRelayProvider` as its `parser`. This package declares no dependency on it, so the application chooses the parser.
- `@orkestrel/router` — one dispatcher a `RelayHandler` mounts on. The handler is fetch-standard, so any router that routes a `Request` to a `Response` works.
- [`queue.md`](queue.md) — the bounded-concurrency, retrying, durable `Queue` `createAgentQueue` composes for many agent jobs.
- [`workflow.md`](workflow.md) — the `SchedulerInterface` the loop yields to between turns, and the fail-fast `Runner` `createAgentRunner` composes for sub-agent fan-out.
- [`emitter.md`](emitter.md) — the foundational observable primitive the `Agent` owns as its push `emitter`; `AgentEventMap` is its event map, wired through the reserved `on` option.
- [`tool.md`](tool.md) — the tool runtime this loop advertises from and dispatches through: definitions, calls, and the success-discriminated `ToolResult`.
- [`workspace.md`](workspace.md) — the file domain whose active workspace `AgentContext` renders into a turn: files, editing, events, and persistence.
- [`contract.md`](contract.md) — the shape DSL other tools (for example `@orkestrel/toolbox`'s `createWorkspaceTool`) compile against; the shared `describedLiteral` (a discriminant's description-carrier) and `schemaToParameters` (the tool-parameters narrowing) live there.
- [`database.md`](database.md) — the `DriverInterface` / `TableInterface` seam `createDatabaseConversationStore` persists conversation snapshots through.
- [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — the repository's authority pointer; the coding rules it resolves to live in `@orkestrel/scaffold`.
- [`README.md`](README.md) — the guides index.
