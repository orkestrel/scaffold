# Larkspur benchmark harness

This directory holds the harness that measures the records arm against the full view on the Larkspur support shift: two agent builds, the scenario files, the scorer, the series tools, and the blind-audit kit. Everything in it finds its siblings from its own location, so you can run it from any working directory. A relative path that you pass (`--plan`, `--base`, `--out`) resolves against your working directory.

`MIGRATION.md` maps every file to its source under the untracked tree this harness was copied from, with both checksums and the exact lines that changed.

## Layout

The following table names each directory and what it holds.

| Path | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `bench/` | The full view and compaction harness (`bench.mjs`), the scorer (`rescore.mjs`), `scenario.json`, `scenario-long.json`, the reworded variants in `variants/` and `variants/ledger/`, the date renderer in `dated/`, the scoring-rule tooling in `u2/`, and the per-requirement scorer in `goals/`, which reads the recorded runs under `../results/`. |
| `bench3/` | The records harness (`bench.mjs`, `records.mjs`), its offline check (`records-check.mjs`), `records-fixtures.json`, and its `scenario.json`. |
| `tools/` | The series tools: `plan.ts`, `series.ts`, `run-one.ts`, `cold-start.mjs`, the wire recorder `record-fetch.mjs`, and the offline judge-import probe `probe-judge.mjs`. |
| `models/` | The candidate-model pilot: `plan.mjs`, `pilot.mjs`, `sweep.sh`. |
| `audit/` | The blind-audit kit for the v10 series (`audit.js`, `items.ts`, `tally.ts`, `inspect.ts`, `adjudicated.ts`, `extract.ts`) and for the g06 series (`g06-audit.js`, `items.mjs`, `probe-items.mjs`, `collect.mjs`, `replay.mjs`, `trace.mjs`, `variants.mjs`). |
| `bench5/` | The aggregate arm's files. `seams.ts` probes an agent build for the seams the arm relies on, and `tests/seams.test.ts` proves the probe. |
| `data/` | The inputs the harness reads by default: `cal-categories.jsonl` and the `ledger-deny-first/` record. |
| `vendor/` | The library builds the runs import: the two builds every measured run imported, and the 0.0.30 agent build of the aggregate arm. |
| `tmp/` | The default output root for raw series output. Git ignores it, so it does not exist after a checkout; you create it when you start a series. |

## Set up

Install the pinned dependencies once. The `.ts` tools run without a flag on Node 22.22.0, the version the checks in `MIGRATION.md` ran on:

```sh
cd .orkestrel/agent/instruments/harness
npm install
```

The live runs need an Ollama daemon at `http://127.0.0.1:11434` that serves the models the plan names. The offline checks in the final section need no daemon.

## Plan and run a series

A series is a plan file that `tools/series.ts` works through one run at a time, resumable and inside a time budget. Follow these steps.

1. Create the output base. The tools create the run folders under it but not the base itself, so run `mkdir -p tmp/SERIES` first, where `SERIES` is the series name, for example `v12`. The documented default base is `tmp/SERIES` under this directory.
2. Write the plan. Use `tools/plan.ts` for the final-check arms (records, full view, compaction) under named conditions, or `models/plan.mjs` for one candidate model against the records arm and the full view:

```sh
node tools/plan.ts --copies 1-8 --conditions f4 --out tmp/SERIES/plan.json
node models/plan.mjs --model MODEL_TAG --prefix NAME --copies 1-8 --out tmp/SERIES/plan.json
```

3. Launch the series under the dispatch skill's `launch.ts`, from the scaffold checkout root, so the harness tracks the process and a cap ends it. `CAP` is the launcher cap in seconds, which must exceed `BUDGET`, the series time budget in seconds; `HARNESS` is the path `.orkestrel/agent/instruments/harness`:

```sh
node .agents/skills/orkestrel-dispatch/scripts/launch.ts --journal tmp/codex/SERIES.jsonl --errors tmp/codex/SERIES.err --cap CAP -- node HARNESS/tools/series.ts --plan HARNESS/tmp/SERIES/plan.json --base HARNESS/tmp/SERIES --budget BUDGET
```

`series.ts` calls `run-one.ts` for each planned run. `run-one.ts` unloads every model, appends a start line to `BASE/run.log`, runs `bench/bench.mjs` or `bench3/bench.mjs` with the `record-fetch.mjs` preload, and ends the line with the harness file's SHA-256. `run-one.ts` resolves `BASE` against your working directory before it passes `--out` to the harness, so a relative `--base` writes under that directory and not under `bench/` or `bench3/`. The vendored builds are not in that hash, so record their checksums from the vendored builds section in the series notes.

The `harness-sha256` value of a run in this directory differs from the value that the same harness logged in the source tree, because the migration edited how the files find each other. The v11 series logged `67c863…` (`bench3/bench.mjs`) and `b5c49e…` (`bench/bench.mjs`); the files in this directory hash to `19b1d8…` and `9bed44…`. These pairs denote the same behavior, so do not read the change as a harness change. `MIGRATION.md` lists the edited lines.

## Keep raw output and curated readings apart

Raw output stays in `tmp/SERIES/`, which git ignores and which stays on disk: each run's `.jsonl`, its `.log`, its `-wire/` recording, and `run.log`. Curated readings (grades, aggregates, audit verdicts, and keys) go in the sibling directory `../results/SERIES/`, which git tracks.

Four readers take their inputs from `../results/` and not from `tmp/`. Three of them are the `--probe-chain` and `--probe-score` flags of `bench/bench.mjs`, and `bench/u2/compare.mjs`; they read raw run folders that the tracked results do not hold, so place those folders under `../results/` before you run them. The fourth, `bench3/records-check.mjs`, reads the tracked plan `../results/v9/RECORDS-PLAN.md`, so the harness directory is not self-contained when you move it without `../results/`. Four audit tools locate a series directory themselves: `audit/extract.ts` and `audit/adjudicated.ts` read `../results/v10`, and `audit/collect.mjs` and `audit/replay.mjs` read `../results/g06`. Set the environment variable `V10_RESULTS` or `G06_RESULTS` to a directory to read a series from `tmp/` instead. The other audit tools take their directories as arguments. `models/sweep.sh` reads the recorded g06 requests from the directory in `G06_RESULTS` and refuses to start without it; `models/pilot.mjs` takes the request files as arguments.

## Vendored builds

The harness imports the agent build from `vendor/agent/index.js` and loads the judge from `vendor/ollama/index.js`. The judge loads from a separate build because the ollama package inherits its own copy of `@orkestrel/agent`, whose error classes differ from the vendored agent build's. The following table records the bytes.

| File | Source | File time | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vendor/agent/index.js` | `/home/user/agent/dist/src/core/index.js` | 2026-10-08 19:31 UTC | `4db78c23046e9a1b081682d55779a5fd8f88dc904a2caf50e761a28cf36e5f51` |
| `vendor/ollama/index.js` | `/home/user/ollama/dist/src/core/index.js` | 2026-10-07 14:44 UTC | `e09277478a425e6227f37730a29b2df5d9f80cfc595740cd0335fa05da22b4a7` |
| `vendor/agent-0.0.30/index.js` | `/home/user/agent-release/dist/src/core/index.js` at commit `c04eea4` (`@orkestrel/agent` 0.0.30) | 2026-10-10 03:10 UTC | `066f7368af737eb34bc839abf3f69397f21efe95edb2a81f1637492a8ed2e911` (declarations in `index.d.ts`: `f5ff3e5098a0b581c5a43728fe29910e3c081458741f27f104e26d52b954e77d`) |

The `vendor/agent-0.0.30/index.js` build carries the ledger of the aggregate arm. Its `src` is identical to the measured port at `8f5098b`, and it is the build the units of the aggregate arm start from. Its bare imports are `@orkestrel/abort`, `budget`, `contract`, `database`, `emitter`, `queue`, `timeout`, `tool`, `workflow`, and `workspace`, each at the version `package.json` pins. After the agent trim lands, vendor the trimmed build as a further directory, keep both rows in the table, and rerun `bench5/seams.ts` and every offline proof against the trimmed build before Stage 0. `vendor/agent/index.js` stays untouched.

The bare imports in both builds and in the harness resolve from `node_modules`. `package.json` pins each package to the version that the source checkouts held on 2026-10-10, the date of the migration, including `@orkestrel/agent` 0.0.29 for the ollama build.

### Re-vendor an agent build

Replace a vendored build only on purpose, because a different build changes the requests a run sends. Follow these steps.

1. Build the agent checkout, then copy its `dist/src/core/index.js` over `vendor/agent/index.js`.
2. Read the versions of the `@orkestrel/*` packages that the build imports from the checkout's `node_modules`, edit the pins in `package.json` to match, and run `npm install`.
3. Run the offline checks in the following section and compare their output with the output from the previous build.
4. Record the new SHA-256 and build time in the table in this file and add a section to `MIGRATION.md` that names the source checkout and the reason.
5. Treat any series that follows as a different measurement from the series before it, and say so in that series' notes.

## Run the offline checks

These commands read no daemon. Run them from this directory.

```sh
node bench3/bench.mjs --check-ledger
node bench3/records-check.mjs
node bench/bench.mjs --probe-guard
node bench/bench.mjs --probe-exchanges
node bench/variants/check.mjs
node --test bench/dated/check.mjs
node tools/probe-judge.mjs
node bench5/seams.ts --build vendor/agent-0.0.30/index.js
node --test bench5/tests/seams.test.ts
```

`tools/probe-judge.mjs` blocks `fetch`, imports `vendor/ollama/index.js`, and constructs a judge without calling it; it exits 0 and prints `fetch calls 0`, and it exits non-zero when the vendored judge build or its `@orkestrel/agent` resolution is missing or broken.

`bench5/seams.ts --build PATH [--json]` blocks `fetch`, imports the build at `PATH`, constructs a ledger from an inert provider and an inert judge, and prints one line per seam, the build's SHA-256, and `fetch calls N`. It exits 0 when every seam holds, 1 when a seam fails or the build does not import, and 64 on a usage error. A seam line that starts with `FAIL` names the export or member that is missing or changed. Run it against any agent build before you vendor that build, and compare the printed digest with the table row.

No other check loads the judge build. `bench/variants/check.mjs` exits 2 and the `CLI` case of `bench/dated/check.mjs` fails; both fail the same way in the original tree, so a failure there is not a sign of a broken copy. `node --test bench/dated/check.mjs` also rewrites files under `bench/dated/`; run it in a scratch copy when you need those files unchanged.

## Read the older documents

`bench/README.md`, `bench3/README.md`, and the two `BRIEFING.md` files are byte copies of the originals. They name the original absolute paths (`/home/user/agent/tmp/...`) in their commands and history; read each path as the matching location in this directory, and use `MIGRATION.md` to map them.
